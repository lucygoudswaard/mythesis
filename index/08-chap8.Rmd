# Combining MR and an RCT to determine effects of adiposity on the plasma proteome. {#Comparison-proteome}

## Background

The two previous results chapters (Chapter \@ref(BMI-protein-MR) and Chapter \@ref(BMI-protein-RCT)) aimed to determine the effect of adiposity on circulating proteins by using two different study designs: an MR study which evaluated the effect of prolonged high BMI has on protein levels and an RCT which explored the effect of weight loss through caloric restriction on the plasma proteome. These two studies provided two separate line of evidence for a causal role of adiposity in circulating protein composition. Both studies also provided evidence that the change in circulating proteins may be contributing to the increased risk of disease such as metabolic disease and cardiovascular disease. This overall shift in proteins provides important information. One of the benefits of having the same proteomics platform in both studies is that there is a large overlap in the number of proteins measured. Each approach has its own biases and limitations and both the concordance and divergence in effects across studies provides insight into possible mechanisms. The overall aim of this chapter is to compare BMI-protein effects across MR and RCT study designs and evaluate implications for platelet function and cardiovascular disease.

## Methods
In efforts to further elucidate which proteins are altered by adiposity, a comparison between the BMI-protein associations in INTERVAL (Chapter \@ref(BMI-protein-MR)) and the BMI change-protein change associations in the current analyses was also performed using a linear regression of the raw estimates. There were 2803 unique proteins (by UniProt ID) which were detected in both INTERVAL and DiRECT. Estimates across the two cohorts were compared using linear regression. To be able to compare whether estimates are similar across study designs, estimates from each analysis were scaled using the scale() function from the "base" R package. Estimates were categorised as: similar if the scaled estimates were within 1 SD of each other; different if estimates were more than 1 SD apart and extreme if within 1 SD of each other and with an absolute scaled estimate of more than 1 SD. 

## Results
### Comparison of BMI effects across DiRECT and INTERVAL
BMI-protein estimates from this study were compared with effect estimates from INTERVAL (Chapter \@ref(BMI-protein-MR)), where 2803 proteins were detected across both studies. Both cohorts, through use of different study designs, provided evidence for an effect of BMI on the plasma proteome. Figure \@ref(fig:DiRECT-INTERVAL) shows the BMI-protein estimates for the proteins which were included in both DiRECT and INTERVAL (R^2^=0.11, P=1.0x10^77^).  There was consistent evidence across both studies that higher BMI leads to higher levels of various proteins including fumarylacetoacetase (FAAA), alcohol dehydrogenase 4 (ADH4), growth hormone receptor (GHR) and carboxypeptidase M (CBPM). Furthermore, higher BMI had a lowering effect on levels of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), as well as insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1/2 (IGFBP1/2). Although some of these estimates did not pass multiple testing in INTERVAL, the concordance in estimates in terms of effect size and direction of effect suggests that this is an issue of power.

The divergence in magnitude of estimates across study designs also suggests that some proteins are only associated with BMI on one study design. For example, the estimates in INTERVAL suggested that BMI has an effect on complement factors such as Complement C5 and Complement Factor I. As seen in Figure \@ref(fig:DiRECT-INTERVAL-group), these complement factors as well as others group together, where they appear to have relationship with BMI in INTERVAL but are not affected by weight loss in DiRECT. There are other proteins which show the opposite: SCAR5 and CHAD displayed strong associations with BMI change in DiRECT, however the MR did not detect a causal effect of BMI on levels of these proteins \@ref(fig:DiRECT-INTERVAL-group).

Some platelet proteins were associated with BMI in the observational analysis in INTERVAL, such as PAFAH and PEAR1. PAFAH did not pass multiple testing in the MR analysis, however the estimate was similar to the observational estimate. PAFAH was associated with BMI change in DiRECT in the instrumental variable analysis. The direction of the effect indicated that higher BMI is associated with reduction in circulating PAFAH. In agreement with this, a reduction in BMI lead to levels of PAFAH increasing. The estimates for PAFAH were similar and can be seen in Figure \@ref(fig:DiRECT-INTERVAL).

## Discussion
This chapter brought together results from two different analyses to determine effects of adiposity on the plasma proteome (INTERVAL in Chapter \@ref(BMI-protein-MR) and DiRECT in Chapter \@(BMI-protein-RCT)). Comparisons of protein effects across the different study designs points towards proteins of interest which may be involved in the development or progression of obesity-associated cardiometabolic disease. Proteins which are only altered in one study design could also provide useful biological information as to how the individual protein may relate to adiposity.

The comparison of results from Chapter \@ref(BMI-protein-MR), which used MR and observational associations to assess the effect of average higher BMI across a population on average protein levels, with results from an RCT in Chapter \@(BMI-protein-RCT) provides two separate lines of evidence to suggest a causal role of BMI in levels of various proteins. The analysis in INTERVAL suggested that proteins most altered by BMI were enriched for diseases such as cardiovascular disease and metabolic disease. As the estimates for the effect of BMI on proteins were consistent across both DiRECT and INTERVAL, this suggests that weight loss is able to reverse the protein changes observed with higher BMI, thereby potentially reducing disease risk. Although previous studies have identified BMI effects on some of these proteins, this direct comparison of effect estimates across an MR study design and weight loss intervention for the general proteome has not yet been done in this manner. This is a key strength of the study. The RCT had fewer participants than INTERVAL (265 vs 2737), but had enough power to detect an effect of BMI change on over 100 proteins. Proteins identified which would benefit following up, based on consistencies across study designs, include SHBG, IGFBP1/2, and GHR. The comparison has also highlighted some more novel proteins such as FAAA and PAFAH, which require further study.

The agreement in effect estimates across study designs for the platelet protein PAFAH suggests that higher BMI does affect levels of this protein and that it is likely the power issue which means it cannot be detected in the MR. The power analysis in the discussion of Chapter \@(BMI-protein-MR) supports this as it was calculated than an effect size of ±0.33 SDs would be required to have a power of 80%. This protein has been suggested to be antiatherogenic, therefore lower levels would be proatherogenic[@Noto2003]. Validating this protein in an independent cohort and investigating this protein further in the lab could help reveal the functional implications of changes in PAFAH. This protein provides a good example of how triangulating can help tease apart the protein effects which are more likely to be driven by BMI.

Divergence in estimates across study designs may also suggest that there are spurious relationships occurring. However, this divergence may also provide some insight into the biology due to the nature of each study design. In general, the MR study design provides insight into the effect on the proteome that a sustained high BMI has over the life course and is therefore indicative of chronic effects. In contrast, the estimates in DiRECT are the effect that acute weight loss (1 year) has on the proteome. Complement factors may be altered in the MR study, but not after a weight loss intervention because weight loss may not have been sustained long enough to induce changes at the proteome level. There was no evidence for a causal relationship between BMI and both SCAR5 and CHAD in the MR, but these proteins displayed strong associations with weight loss in DiRECT. This could be because these protein changes are signals of starvation or due to other changes that happen with caloric restriction, such as a change of medication or loss of muscle mass. This requires further exploration, and requires more formal analysis to disentangle effects.

Overall, this chapter brought together two different study designs which aimed to determine the effect of adiposity on the plasma proteome. Through directly comparing the magnitude of estimates, this chapter identifies proteins which have the strongest evidence for a BMI effect (SHBG, IGFBP1/2, GHR, FAAA), as well as identifying a role of BMI in levels of circulating PAFAH, which may have implications for atherosclerosis. Divergence in estimates indicates effects which may be specific to one study design such as a causal effect of BMI on complement factors in the MR, but the inability to reverse these effects with weight loss. Replicating in other cohorts is now required to further understand these relationships.
