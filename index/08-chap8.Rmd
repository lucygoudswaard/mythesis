# Combining MR and an RCT to determine effects of adiposity on the plasma proteome {#Comparison-proteome}

## Background

The two previous results chapters (Chapter \@ref(BMI-protein-MR) and Chapter \@ref(BMI-protein-RCT)) aimed to determine the effect of adiposity on circulating proteins by using two different study designs: an MR study which evaluated the effect that prolonged high BMI has on protein levels and an RCT which explored the effect of weight loss through caloric restriction on the plasma proteome. These two studies provided two separate line of evidence for a causal role of adiposity in circulating protein composition. Both studies also provided evidence that the change in circulating proteins may be contributing to the increased risk of disease such as metabolic disease or CVD. There was also evidence from both studies for an effect of BMI on certain proteins involved in platelet GO pathways, thereby indicating that these protein alterations could impact platelet function and risk of CVD.

This overall shift in proteins in each study design provides important information. One of the benefits of having the same proteomics platform in both studies is that there is a large overlap in the number of proteins measured, therefore the MR estimate and RCT estimate can be directly compared. A comparison across the two studies also helps to overcome the biases and limitations of each approach, and both the concordance and divergence in effects across studies provides insight into possible mechanisms. The overall aim of this chapter was to compare BMI-protein effects across MR and RCT study designs and evaluate implications for platelet function and CVD.

## Methods
In efforts to further elucidate which proteins are altered by adiposity, a comparison between the BMI-protein associations in INTERVAL (Chapter \@ref(BMI-protein-MR)) and the BMI change-protein change associations in Chapter \@ref(BMI-protein-RCT) was performed. There were 2803 unique proteins (by UniProt ID) which were detected in both INTERVAL and DiRECT. Estimates across the two cohorts were compared using linear regression. The estimate in INTERVAL is the mean difference in protein levels per SD higher BMI in a cross-sectional framework, whereas the estimate in DiRECT is the SD change in protein levels after weight loss. Due to the nature of the output of linear regression, the beta coefficient is the SD change in protein per SD increase in BMI (therefore if weight loss reduces the protein, the beta coefficient is positive). To be able to compare whether estimates were similar across study designs, estimates from each analysis were scaled using the scale() function from the "base" R package. This function subtracts the mean from each value and divides by the standard deviation. Estimates were categorised as: "same" if the scaled estimates were within 1 SD of each other; "different" if estimates were more than 1 SD apart and "extreme" if within 1 SD of each other and with an absolute scaled estimate of more than 1 SD. Estimates from both studies were scaled as the beta coefficients for the regression analyses were using different units (INTERVAL units are SD difference in protein per SD higher BMI in a cross-sectional setting, whereas DiRECT is SD change in protein per SD increase in BMI).

Estimates for the specific proteins involved in platelet GO pathways highlighted in Chapters \@ref(BMI-protein-MR) and \@ref(BMI-protein-RCT) (Supplementary Table 1 https://github.com/lucygoudswaard/mythesis/blob/master/index/figure/BMI_protein_INTERVAL/BMI_protein_supplementary_Tables.xlsx) were also extracted to evaluate the effect of BMI on platelet proteins. Estimates were extracted from the MR in INTERVAL and for the two stage least squares analysis in DiRECT as these were the most robust models.

The comparison of the magnitude of estimates across studies conveys important information. Firstly, proteins which have a consistent direction across both INTERVAL and DiRECT, as well as having large magnitudes of estimates in both studies provides more compelling evidence for a BMI-driven effect. As an example, a positive estimate in both studies indicates that within a population, those with a higher BMI would likely have higher levels of the protein and that if an individual reduces their BMI with caloric restriction it would likely reduce the levels of the protein. Secondly, the comparison conveys proteins which have consistent evidence across both studies but with small magnitudes of estimates provides evidence that the protein levels are not affected by BMI. The comparison can also highlight disparities in estimates, where there may be evidence from only one study that the protein is altered by BMI. This either points towards effects which are study specific, or possible spurious associations arising in one study. 

## Results
### Comparison of BMI effects across DiRECT and INTERVAL
BMI-protein estimates from this DiRECT were compared with effect estimates from INTERVAL (Chapter \@ref(BMI-protein-MR)), where 2803 proteins were detected across both studies. Both cohorts, through use of different study designs, provided evidence for an effect of BMI on the plasma proteome. Figure \@ref(fig:DiRECT-INTERVAL) shows the BMI-protein estimates for the proteins which were included in both DiRECT and INTERVAL (R^2^=0.11, P=1.0x10^77^). 

The protein effects were either deemed as similar, different or extreme (similar with large estimate) based on the comparison of scaled estimates. There was evidence that 1665 proteins had a similar effect across studies, 968 were different and 170 were extreme. There was consistent evidence across both studies that higher BMI leads to higher levels of various proteins including fumarylacetoacetase (FAAA), alcohol dehydrogenase 4 (ADH4), growth hormone receptor (GHR) and carboxypeptidase M (CBPM). Furthermore, higher BMI had a lowering effect on levels of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), as well as insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1/2 (IGFBP1/2). Although some of these estimates did not pass multiple testing in INTERVAL, the concordance in estimates in terms of effect size and direction of effect suggests that this is an issue of power.

The divergence in magnitude of estimates across study designs also suggests that some proteins are only associated with BMI in one study design. Divergence can be seen in Figure \@ref(fig:DiRECT-INTERVAL-group), where estimates around zero for the DiRECT estimate, but large magnitudes (either positive or negative) in INTERVAL indicates an effect specific to INTERVAL. Similarly, estimates around zero for the INTERVAL estimate but large magnitudes of estimate in DiRECT indicates a specific effect in DiRECT. By exploring the proteins in all four regions of this graph there are two groups which stand out. The first is a group of complement factors. For example, the estimates in INTERVAL suggested that BMI has an effect on complement factors such as Complement C5 and Complement Factor I. As seen in Figure \@ref(fig:DiRECT-INTERVAL-group), these complement factors as well as others such as Complement Factor 5a group together, where they appear to have a relationship with BMI in INTERVAL but are not affected by weight loss in DiRECT. There are other proteins which show the opposite: SCAR5 and CHAD displayed strong associations with BMI change in DiRECT, however the MR did not detect a causal effect of BMI on levels of these proteins \@ref(fig:DiRECT-INTERVAL-group). There was no clear other grouping of proteins.

Across both INTERVAL and DiRECT, 170 proteins involved in platelet GO pathways were detected. The comparison of estimates for these proteins is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:DiRECT-INTERVAL-platelet), with categorisation of whether the estimates were different, the same or extreme based on the distribution of the 170 scaled estimates from both study designs. Overall, the estimates were associated with each other (R^2^=0.19, p=1.1x10^-9^), which was a stronger association than that seen for all proteins in Figure \@ref(fig:DiRECT-INTERVAL-group). However, there were divergences in estimates for some proteins. Thirteen proteins were categorised as extreme (similar with large estimates), with 102 categorised as the same and 55 as different. Proteins which had consistent evidence across study designs, with the greatest magnitude of estimates include PAFAH, PAI-1 and Complement Factor B. PAFAH was associated with BMI in the observational analysis in INTERVAL. However, PAFAH did not pass multiple testing in the MR analysis. Despite this, the estimate was similar in magnitude to the observational estimate. PAFAH was also associated with BMI change in DiRECT in the instrumental variable analysis. The direction of the effect indicated that higher BMI is associated with a reduction in circulating PAFAH. In agreement with this, a reduction in BMI led to higher levels of PAFAH. The estimates for PAFAH were similar in Figure \@ref(fig:DiRECT-INTERVAL-platelet). The consistencies in magnitude and direction of estimates for the platelet proteins highlighted in green, in particular PAFAH, PAI-1 and complement factor B suggest that platelet proteome alterations due to variation in BMI likely has downstream effects on the platelet environment.

## Discussion
This chapter brought together results from two different analyses to determine effects of adiposity on the plasma proteome (INTERVAL in Chapter \@ref(BMI-protein-MR) and DiRECT in Chapter \@ref(BMI-protein-RCT)). Comparisons of protein effects across the different study designs points towards proteins of interest which may be involved in the development or progression of obesity-associated cardiometabolic disease. This chapter also collated the results for the proteins which have been implicated in pathways relevant to platelets. 

The comparison of results from Chapter \@ref(BMI-protein-MR), which used MR and observational associations to assess the effect of average higher BMI across a population on average protein levels, with results from an RCT in Chapter \@ref(BMI-protein-RCT) provides two separate lines of evidence to suggest a causal role of BMI in levels of various proteins. The analysis in INTERVAL suggested that proteins most altered by BMI were enriched for diseases such as CVD and metabolic disease. As the estimates for the effect of BMI on various proteins were consistent across both DiRECT and INTERVAL, this suggests that weight loss is able to reverse the protein changes observed with higher BMI, thereby potentially reducing disease risk. Despite this observation, for many proteins, there was consistent evidence across studies that BMI does not have an effect. Although previous studies have identified BMI effects on some of these proteins, this direct comparison of effect estimates across an MR study design and weight loss intervention for the general proteome has not yet been done in this manner. This is a key strength of the study. The RCT had fewer participants than INTERVAL (265 vs 2737), but had enough power to detect an effect of BMI change on over 100 proteins. Proteins identified which would benefit following up, based on consistencies across study designs, include SHBG, IGFBP1/2, and GHR. The comparison has also highlighted some more novel proteins such as FAAA and PAFAH, which require further study.

Overall, estimates for the effect of BMI on platelet proteins in DiRECT and INTERVAL displayed a positive association. The agreement in effect estimates across study designs for the platelet protein PAFAH suggests that higher BMI does affect levels of this protein and that it is likely the power issue which means it cannot be detected in the MR. The power analysis in the discussion of Chapter \@ref(BMI-protein-MR) supports this as it was calculated that an effect size of ±0.33 SDs would be required to have a power of 80%. This protein has been suggested to be antiatherogenic, therefore lower levels would be proatherogenic[@Noto2003]. There is also evidence in mice that knocking out PAFAH increases the weight of male mice, therefore indicating that PAFAH could be important in weight regulation[@Nakamura2021]. A reverse MR analysis using SNPs associated with higher levels of PAFAH could help determine whether there is a likely causal role for PAFAH in weight regulation in humans. Validating this protein in an independent cohort and investigating this protein further in the lab could help reveal the functional implications of changes in PAFAH. This protein provides a good example of how triangulating can help tease apart the protein effects which are more likely to be driven by BMI. There were 12 other platelet proteins where there was evidence for consistency across both studies, including PAI-1 and Complement Factor B. These proteins would benefit from being followed up by examining in cardiovascular cohorts or by performing platelet function studies on isolated platelets.

Divergence in estimates across study designs may also suggest that there are spurious relationships occurring in one of the studies. However, this divergence may also provide some insight into the biology due to the nature of each study design. In general, the MR study design provides insight into the effect on the proteome that a sustained high BMI has over the life course and is therefore indicative of chronic effects. In contrast, the estimates in DiRECT are the effect that acute weight loss (1 year) and T2D remission has on the proteome. Complement factors may be altered in the MR study, but not after a weight loss intervention because weight loss may not have been sustained long enough to induce changes at the proteome level. There was no evidence for a causal relationship between BMI and both SCAR5 and CHAD in the MR, but these proteins displayed strong associations with weight loss in DiRECT. This could be because these protein changes are signals of starvation or due to other changes that happen with caloric restriction, such as a change of medication, T2D remission or loss of muscle mass. This requires further exploration, and requires more formal analysis to disentangle effects.

One of the limitations of the analyses performed in Chapter \@ref(BMI-protein-MR) and Chapter \@ref(BMI-protein-RCT) is that many proteins are not in the SOMAscan in both studies. Out of 4,034 SOMAmers in INTERVAL and 4601 SOMAmers in DiRECT, there were 2803 proteins in both. This means that there would be other proteins which would likely have reproducible effects across study (such as leptin). Therefore, this is limiting which proteins are discussed in the current chapter. Another limitation of the current chapter is that the thresholds set for this comparison are arbitrary, so the thresholds for what defines an estimate as similar or different is user defined. However, in the absence of other ways to compare units which lie on different scales, this was the most systematic way to do so.

Overall, this chapter brought together two different study designs which aimed to determine the effect of adiposity on the plasma proteome. Through directly comparing the magnitude of estimates, this chapter identifies proteins which have the strongest evidence for a BMI effect (SHBG, IGFBP1/2, GHR, FAAA), as well as identifying a role of BMI in levels of circulating PAFAH, which may have implications for atherosclerosis. Divergence in estimates indicates effects which may be specific to one study design such as a causal effect of BMI on complement factors in the MR, but the inability to reverse these effects with weight loss. Replicating in other cohorts is now required to further understand these relationships.
