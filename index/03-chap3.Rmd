# Common methods used without the thesis

This chapter will provide an overview of datasets and methods which are utilised in more than one results chapter. Each chapter will refer back to these methods where relevant and include further methodological details specific to the chapter.

## The INTERVAL study

### Study overview
INTERVAL is a prospective cohort study that initially aimed to test the safety of reducing the time interval between donation of whole blood in 50,000 participants [@DiAngelantonio2017]. Participants were over the age of 18 years, able to provide informed consent and free from a history of major disease. Participants were recruited between June 11th, 2012 and June 15th, 2014 from 25 National Health Service Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) centres across England. They filled out online questionnaires including self-reported height and weight, smoking status and alcohol consumption. Blood samples were also taken at baseline (before randomization within the study) where full blood counts were obtained. The study was approved by Cambridge East Research Ethics Committee. Permission for data access was provided by the Data Access Committee. Data contains sensitive content and requires permission to use therefore cannot be made publicly available. Access to data needs to be approved by the INTERVAL team www.intervalstudy.org.uk/more-information.


### Genetic data and instrument for BMI

INTERVAL participant genotyping was performed on the Affymetrix GeneTitan Multi-Channel (MC) Instrument using the UK Biobank Axiom Array (ThermoFisher Scientific, Loughborough, UK) and the QC of genotype data was implemented as described by Astle et al. [@Astle2016]. The imputation panel used was the 1000 genomes phase-3-UK-10K [@Astle2016]. A genetic instrument for BMI was constructed using 654 genetic variants that were associated with BMI at P<5x10^-8^ in the inverse variance weighted fixed-effect meta-analysis of GWAS of 700000 individuals of European ancestry [@Yengo2018]. This meta-analysis consisted of around 250000 adults from the Genetic Investigation of ANthromopetric Traits (GIANT) consortium [@Locke2015] and 450000 adults from the UK Biobank study. Only 0.05 % of UK Biobank participants were included in the current INTERVAL study (of N=2737). These participants were not excluded to increase power. The weighted GRS was made using PLINK 2.0 software [@Purcell2007a] using the effect alleles and beta coefficients from the source GWAS. The score was calculated by multiplying the number of effect alleles at each SNP by its effect estimate (beta), summing these, and dividing by the total number of SNPs included. The GRS therefore can be interpreted as the average per-SNP effect on BMI for each individual.
