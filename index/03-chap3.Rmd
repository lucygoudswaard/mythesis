# Using observational and MR frameworks to determine the effect of body mass index on platelet characteristics {#BMI-platelets-INTERVAL}

This work is published in the journal Platelets[@Goudswaard2022]. The preprint of this manuscript is also on MedRXiV[@Goudswaard2021a]. I performed all analyses, created all figures and tables and wrote the manuscript. 

## Background
The introduction chapter (Chapter \@ref(background)) indicated that clinical studies and genetic association studies have identified BMI as an independent risk factor for thrombotic disorders such as CHD and stroke[@Nordestgaard2012; @Dale2017; @Wolk2003a]. Platelet hyperactivity can be an indicator of those who may be at an increased risk of thrombosis[@Puurunen2018]. There is evidence that people with a higher BMI have hyperactive platelets[@Barrachina2019; @Nardin2015], which could explain why a higher BMI is linked to an increase in thrombosis. Platelet function can be directly assessed by various methods (section \@ref(platelet-function-techniques)), but these techniques are not widely available or readily standardized. Haematology analyzers such as the Sysmex XN series are more commonly used to provide full blood counts, providing detailed readouts of platelet characteristics. Mechanisms of platelet hyperactivity are unclear, but it is possible that alterations in properties of platelets such as PLT, MPV and IPF/IPC may contribute to the phenotype. 

Immature platelets (also known as reticulated platelets) are the youngest platelets in circulation and are detected based on having a greater forward scatter (FSC, an indicator of their size) and a greater side fluorescence (SFL, an indicator of their mRNA content)[@Ibrahim2014]. More immature platelets are indicative of enhanced platelet production[@Lev2016a] and these platelets are believed to be more prothrombotic than older circulating platelets, with more dense granule release and increased P-selectin expression[@Ibrahim2014; @Lev2016a; @Bernlochner2015a]. Higher immature platelet count is associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease[@Ibrahim2014] and reduced effectiveness of antiplatelet therapies[@Bernlochner2015a; @Ibrahim2012], suggesting that hyperactive immature platelets may contribute to adverse vascular events. Immature platelets have also been suggested to be less responsive to antiplatelet therapies such as prasugrel in acute coronary syndrome patients[@Bernlochner2015a]. 

As these platelet characteristics provide potential information about platelet hyperactivity and given the increased thrombotic risk seen with adiposity, it is important to assess how adiposity affects platelet properties. Previous studies with modest samples sizes have implemented observational epidemiological methods to explore the effect of BMI on PLT, plateletcrit (PCT) and MPV. There is conflicting observational evidence regarding an association between BMI and PLT[@Furuncuoglu2016; @Han2018a], with some studies suggesting a positive association between BMI and MPV[@Coban2005] and other studies reporting no such association[@Heffron2018]. Furthermore, as there is evidence that immature platelet production is increased in patients with metabolic syndrome and type II diabetes[@Vaduganathan2008a; @Mijovic2015a], it is therefore important to explore whether BMI may be an independent predictor of this trait. It is currently unknown whether the influence of BMI on platelet properties and function are causal and independent of confounding effects.

In this chapter the aim was to use data from the INTERVAL prospective cohort (N=33388) to explore the association between BMI and platelet traits. Figure \@ref(fig:BMI-platelet-overview) shows the associations of the overall thesis hypothesis addressed in the chapter. Here, observational and Mendelian randomisation (MR) approaches were employed to test the hypothesis that higher BMI leads to changes in platelet characteristics. Although observational studies can demonstrate associations between BMI and platelet characteristics, they cannot determine direct causality. To address the latter, MR was employed using a genetic risk score derived from single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with higher BMI (Figure \@ref(fig:Linear-reg-MR)). This allowed estimation of the causal effect of BMI on platelet traits, reducing the effect of confounding factors that are inherent to observational studies. To assess functional implications of BMI-platelet associations, a follow-up analysis was designed to explore the associations between platelet characteristics and whole blood aggregation in a cohort of cardiac surgery patients.

## Methods
## The INTERVAL study {#INTERVAL-study}

### Study overview
INTERVAL is a prospective cohort study that initially aimed to test the safety of reducing the time interval between donation of whole blood in 50,000 participants[@DiAngelantonio2017]. Participants were over the age of 18 years, able to provide informed consent and free from a history of major disease. Participants were recruited between June 11th, 2012 and June 15th, 2014 from 25 National Health Service Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) centres across England. They filled out online questionnaires including self-reported height and weight, smoking status and alcohol consumption. Blood samples were also taken at baseline (before randomisation within the study) where full blood counts were obtained. The study was approved by Cambridge East Research Ethics Committee. Permission for data access was provided by the Data Access Committee. Data contains sensitive content and requires permission to use therefore cannot be made publicly available. Access to data needs to be approved by the INTERVAL team www.intervalstudy.org.uk/more-information.

### Assessment of BMI and covariables

Participants completed online questionnaires wherein they reported their height and weight. BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of their height in metres (kg/m^2^). Available covariables were age, sex, previous or current smoking frequency (in three categories of: never, occasional, most days or every day) and alcohol intake frequency (in four categories of: rarely, less than once a week, 1-2 times a week, 3-5 times a week or most days for the proteomics analysis, or three categories of never, previous and current in the platelet trait analysis). These variables were selected to include in analyses as covariables as they were available in the INTERVAL study and likely affect both adiposity and cardiometabolic health[@Bell2018a].

### Genetic data and instrument for BMI

The Affymetrix GeneTitan Multi-Channel (MC) Instrument was used to genotype participants using the UK Biobank Axiom Array (ThermoFisher Scientific, Loughborough, UK). The quality control (QC) of the genetic data has been described in full by Astle et al.[@Astle2016]. The panel used to impute missing genetic data was the 1000 genomes phase-3-UK-10K[@Astle2016]. Genetic variants that were deemed as primary signals from a recent meta-analysis of GWAS for BMI (654 at p<5x10^-8^) were used to make a genetic risk score (GRS). The meta-analysis was conducted on around 700,000 participants of European descent, 250,000 of which were from the Genetic Investigation of ANthromopetric Traits (GIANT) consortium[@Locke2015] and 450,000 from the UK Biobank. This GRS was created using PLINK 2.0[@Purcell2007a], where the effect alleles and betas were obtained from the source GWAS. The score for each participant was calculated by 1) multiplying the number of BMI-increasing SNPs by the beta coefficient of each genetic variant, 2) calculating the sum for all genetic variants, 3) dividing this sum by the number of participants (N). This GRS can be interpreted as the average effect that one SNP has on BMI.

### Study population

The present study was conducted on up to 33388 European ancestry INTERVAL participants living in the United Kingdom. These were the participants who had genetic data, had basic phenotype data and full blood count measures (Figure \@ref(fig:INTERVAL-STROBE)).

### Measurement of platelet traits
Blood was taken by venipuncture into 3mL ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) tubes. Platelet parameters were measured using the Sysmex XN-1000 instrument[@Astle2016]. This analyzer provides information on cell counts by using a combination of fluorescence (PLT-F) and impedance (I) flow cytometry. The PLT-F channel used a Fluorocell fluorescent dye (oxazine), whereas the impedance method uses electrical resistance to detect platelets. Platelet indices included in the current study, along with the raw units, are provided in Table \@ref(tab:Platelet-traits). These measurements were pre-adjusted for technical covariates such as time between venipuncture and blood count, as well as instrument drift, seasonal and weekly variation[@Astle2016]. Adjustment was performed with cyclic, thin-plate and P-splines in a generalized additive model (GAM)[@Akbari2020]. Resulting platelet trait values along with their units of measurement are reported in Table \@ref(tab:Platelet-traits). These data were rank normal transformed to normalize the distribution of each trait. Therefore, each platelet index is measured in normalized standard deviation (SD) units.

### Statistical analysis
Analyses were performed using R version 3.4.2[@Team2019a]. To visualize correlation between outcome platelet variables, a correlation matrix was made using the pairwise Pearson correlation coefficients of the rank normal transformed data. A dendrogram was also created to show the hierarchical relationship between platelet traits (https://github.com/hughesevoanth/iPVs), where the height at which variables are joined is set at (1 – Pearson correlation coefficient (r)). To explore observational associations between BMI and platelet traits, linear regression models were used (lm() function from “stats” package). Two regression models were used: firstly, adjusting for age and sex and secondly, additionally adjusting for smoking and alcohol consumption as ordinal variables. The results of the regression reflect the change in platelet traits (in normalized SD units) per normalized SD higher BMI (4.7 kg/m^2^). Only participants with all covariables were included in the linear regression models. The associations between potential covariables with both BMI and platelet traits were also explored using linear regression.

To understand properties of the GRS for BMI, the association between the GRS with both BMI and covariables were explored. The MR analysis was performed by using a two-stage least squares (2SLS) regression model (using systemfit() function from “systemfit” package[@Henningsen2007]). The MR causal estimates reflect the change in platelet traits (in SD units) per SD increase in BMI. A Wu-Hausman test was performed to test for endogeneity between observational and MR estimates. Exact beta coefficients, confidence intervals and P values are provided throughout and guide strength of association.

Where there was consistent observational and MR evidence for a BMI effect on platelet traits with potential clinical relevance, additional sensitivity analyses were carried out. Differences in magnitudes of associations across NHS BMI categories was explored, indicative of a non-linear relationship. Specifically, participants were stratified by BMI and the association between BMI and IPC estimated within BMI categories.

### Follow-up analysis to explore the association between immature platelets and aggregation
Motivated by findings from the primary analyses described above, additional observational analyses were conducted using data from the COagulation and Platelet laboratory Testing in Cardiac Surgery (COPTIC) study. The COPTIC study was an observational, single centre cohort study of adults undergoing cardiac surgery at the Bristol Heart Institute with primary objective of examining the relationship between coagulation laboratory parameters and bleeding outcomes after surgery in 2,541 participants[@Mumford2017]. This study was approved by the UK NHS Research Ethics Committee (09/H0104/53).

### COPTIC study variables
Age and sex were reported at baseline. Height and weight were obtained from medical notes. BMI was derived from weight and height (kg/m^2^). Smoking was reported as a categorical variable (0=never smoker, 1=ex-smoker for > 5 years, 2=ex-smoker for 1-5 years, 3=ex-smoker for 30 days-1 year, 4=current smoker). Platelet variables (PLT, MPV, IPF, IPC) were measured using the Sysmex XE-2100 Automated Haematology System (Oxford, UK). Blood samples were taken pre-operatively into 3.2% sodium citrate vacutainers (BD Biosciences, Milton Keynes, UK). Platelet aggregation was measured using Multiplate multiple electrode aggregometry (MEA) (Roche, Rotkreuz, Switzerland), which detects change in electrical impedance when platelets aggregate on metal electrodes. Aggregation was determined by the area under the curve (AUC) in response to platelet agonists including adrenaline (100 mg/mL), thrombin receptor activator peptide 6 test (TRAP-test), ADP-test and arachidonic acid (ASPI-test). Use of a combination of agonists therefore reflects activation of platelets via different pathways: adrenaline acts at the α2 adrenergic receptor, TRAP-6 acts at the protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1), ADP acts at the P2Y12 receptor and arachidonic acid at the Thromboxane A2 (TxA2) receptor.

### COPTIC statistical analysis
The COPTIC dataset in the current analysis included 2,518 participants (23 out of 2,541 participants did not consent for future research). For the current study, only those who were not on antiplatelet therapies (prasugrel, clopidogrel or aspirin) were included (N=655). Extreme outliers that were ± 5 SDs from the mean were removed, and exposures and outcomes were rank normal transformed. Linear regression was used to generate estimates of the association between BMI and platelet parameters within this cohort. Linear regression was used to explore the association between immature platelet count and aggregation, adjusting for age, sex and smoking status.

## Results

### INTERVAL participant characteristics 
Of INTERVAL participants included in the current study (N=33,388), 50.2 % were female. The mean age was 45.3 years (SD of 14.2 years, Table \@ref(tab:INT-participants-platelets)). The mean BMI was 26.4 kg/m^2^ (SD of 4.7 kg/m^2^). The majority of participants were never smokers (58.9 %), with 33.3% and 7.8 % reported as previous and current smokers, respectively. Nearly a third (32.7 %) of participants reported drinking alcohol at least three times a week.

### Correlation between platelet traits in INTERVAL
The Sysmex XN-1000 haematology analyzer measures multiple platelet traits, however many of these traits are closely related measurements and therefore may not be completely independent. Indeed, platelet traits showed a high degree of correlation with each other (Figure \@ref(fig:Corr-mat-dend)), in particular among similar measures. For example, measures of PLT (PLT I/F) and PCT, the latter a measurement of platelet mass, were highly positively correlated with each other but were weakly inversely correlated with other platelet measures. Measures of platelet maturity (IPF, IPC, H-IPF) were highly correlated with each other. In addition, platelet size variables (MPV, P-LCR and PDW) showed strong positive correlations with each other as well as with measures of immature platelets.

### Observational associations between BMI and platelet traits in INTERVAL
Linear regression was performed to determine whether a higher BMI was associated with a change in platelet characteristics. In the confounder adjusted linear regression (Table \@ref(tab:BMI-platelets-adjust)), BMI was positively associated with PCT (0.12 SD higher per SD higher BMI, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.13, P = 9.2 x 10^-88^) and platelet count (PLT (I) 0.11 SD higher per SD higher BMI, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.12, P = 1.0 x 10^-67^). The next strongest association with BMI was the association with SFL (0.06 SD higher per SD increase in BMI, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.07, P = 4.7x10^-23^). BMI also showed a positive association with IPC (0.06 SD higher per SD increase in BMI, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.08, P = 4.8x10^-22^). These results demonstrate that BMI is positively associated with PCT, PLT (I), SFL and IPC in this population. These estimates were very similar to the age and sex only adjusted estimates (Table \@ref(tab:BMI-platelets-unadjust)).

PCT = plateletcrit, PLT (I) = platelet count (impedance channel), PLT (F) = platelet count (PLT-F channel), SFL = side fluorescence, IPC = immature platelet count, PDW = platelet distribution width, FSC = forward scatter, H-IPF = high fluorescence immature platelet fraction, IPF = immature platelet fraction, P-LCR = platelet large cell ration, SSC = side scatter, MPV = mean platelet volume. Eta squared is the proportion of variance explained by the platelet trait in an ANOVA, whereas adjusted R squared is the variance explained by all the predictor variables in the regression model.

### Associations of covariables with BMI and platelet traits in INTERVAL
The association of covariables (age, sex, smoking and alcohol) with BMI were evaluated (Table \@ref(tab:INT-confounders-BMI-platelets)). Included covariables in the analysis showed associations with BMI. Males had a higher BMI than females (0.18 SD, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.21, P = 9.64x10^-64^). Age was positively associated with BMI (0.011 SD higher per year older, 95% CI 0.010 to 0.012, P = 1.11x10^-182^). Alcohol showed an inverse association with BMI and smoking showed a weak positive association with BMI. Associations between covariables (age, sex, smoking, alcohol) and platelet traits were also explored (Figure \@ref(fig:confounder-platelets)). Higher age was generally inversely associated with platelet measures. Males had a lower platelet count and PCT compared to females (PLT-F was 0.57 lower 95% CI -0.60 to -0.55, P = 9.9x10^-324^). Weak associations were detected between smoking and platelet traits such as a positive association between smoking status and immature platelets. Higher alcohol consumption also showed inverse associations with measures of PCT and PLT.

### GRS for BMI associations with BMI and covariables
To estimate the causal effect of BMI on platelet characteristics, MR was performed. The GRS for BMI (the average per SNP effect on BMI) showed a normal distribution (mean 0.08, SD 0.30, range -1.15 to 1.34) and was positively associated with BMI to the degree expected (R^2^ = 0.042, P = 2.3x10^-312^, F=1458, Table \@ref(tab:INT-GRS-confounders-platelets)). The GRS did not associate with sex, however weak associations were detected with alcohol consumption, age, and smoking status. The amount of variance explained by the GRS for BMI on any covariable included did not exceed R^2^ = 0.002 (Table \@ref(tab:INT-GRS-confounders-platelets)). As the GRS associates with BMI but does not strongly associate with the measured covariables, it is thus likely a valid instrument to perform MR.

### Mendelian randomisation estimates for the association between BMI and platelet traits
In the MR analyses, BMI was associated with fewer traits than in the observational analysis (Table \@ref(tab:BMI-platelets-MR), \@ref(fig:BMI-platelet-forest)). The causal estimate for the effect of BMI on SFL was 0.08 SDs per SD increase in BMI (95% CI 0.03 to 0.14, P = 0.003). This estimate was of larger magnitude than the observational estimate. The causal estimate for BMI and IPC was 0.06 SDs per SD increase in BMI (95% CI 0.006 to 0.12, P = 0.03), a similar magnitude of effect to the observational estimate. In the MR analysis, unlike in the observational analysis, the causal estimate did not suggest an effect of BMI on either PCT or PLT. MR estimates did not provide evidence for associations between BMI and other platelet variables. The point estimates were consistently positive, aligning with the positive observational associations seen across the platelet traits. Across all but one (H-IPF) of the platelet phenotypes, differences in directionality of effect comparing observational effects and causal effects predicted by Mendelian randomisation were not observed (Figure \@ref(fig:BMI-platelet-forest)).
The Wu-Hausman test suggested that observational and MR estimates were similar for the majority of platelet traits (P > 0.05), except for measures of platelet count and plateletcrit (P < 0.001) (Table \@ref(tab:BMI-platelets-MR)).

### Stratifying BMI and IPC associations by BMI group
Associations between BMI and IPC stratified by NHS BMI groups (underweight <18.5 kg/m^2^, healthy weight 18.5-24.9kg/m^2^, overweight 25-29.9 kg/m^2^, obesity 30+ kg/m^2^) were explored in efforts to examine non-linearity. IPC had consistent BMI effects across observational and MR analyses. Stratifying by BMI category suggested that the strongest association between BMI and IPC was the overweight category (Table \@ref(tab:BMI-platelets-stratified)).

### Follow-up associations between IPC and whole blood aggregation in COPTIC
Given evidence for a causal effect of BMI on IPC in the MR analysis, the relationship between IPC and platelet activity as a biological parameter of clinical relevance was examined. Whilst this analysis could not be conducted in INTERVAL due to a lack of suitable data, the COPTIC study was utilised in order to further characterise the functional effect of IPC. The COPTIC study is a cohort of cardiac surgery patients, with samples taken pre-surgery. These participants have whole blood aggregation measured, therefore making it possible to determine associations between IPC and aggregation in a clinical setting.

### COPTIC participant characteristics
The total number of COPTIC participants was 2,541. Of these, 2,518 participants gave consent for future research (Table \@ref(tab:COPTIC-participants-platelets)). Participants included in the analysis were those not on antiplatelet therapy (N=655). The majority of participants were male (61.8%), with a mean age of 63.9 years (SD of 16.1). Similar to the INTERVAL cohort, the mean BMI was in the overweight category (27.2 kg/m^2^ with a SD of 4.9 kg/m^2^). The majority of participants were either never smokers or ex-smokers for more than 5 years (89.2 %). The effect estimate for the effect of BMI on IPC was 0.06 (95% CI -0.01 to 0.14, P=0.09) and therefore consistent with that estimated in the INTERVAL cohort (Table \@ref(tab:BMI-platelets-COPTIC)).

### Association between IPC and aggregation in COPTIC cohort

To determine the potential functional effects of variation in IPC, the COPTIC cohort was used to assess the observational association between IPC and whole blood platelet aggregation in response to a range of platelet agonists (Figure \@ref(fig:IPC-aggregation)A). In participants who were not on antiplatelet therapy (up to N=655), there was evidence for a positive association between IPC and aggregation induced by adrenaline (0.13 SD increase per SD increase in IPC, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.21, p=3.7x10^-3^), TRAP-6 (0.11 SD increase per SD increase in IPC, 95% 0.03 to 0.18, p=7.8x10^-3^) and ADP (0.08 SD per SD increase in IPC, 95% 0.01 to 0.0.15, p=0.04). As there was a high correlation among platelet traits (Figure \@ref(fig:IPC-aggregation)A, Figure \@ref(fig:IPC-aggregation)B), the effect of MPV, PLT and IPF were also assessed. PLT was associated with all four measures of aggregation, with a larger effect estimate than IPC (Figure \@ref(fig:IPC-aggregation)A). The finding that IPC does not correlate with PLT however suggests that the effect of IPC on platelet aggregation is independent of the effect of PLT on platelet aggregation (Figure \@ref(fig:IPC-aggregation)B). Fitting PLT alongside IPC as an additional predictor of aggregation had little effect on the IPC effect estimate providing further evidence of independent contributions from the two traits (Figure \@ref(fig:IPC-aggregation)C). Adjustment for PLT in the regression model for the association between IPF and aggregation provided estimates of a similar magnitude to that of IPC and aggregation.

## Discussion

In this chapter data from 33,388 healthy blood donors was used to study the effect of BMI on platelet phenotypes including measures of count, size and maturity. The combination of observational and MR estimates suggested a positive causal effect of BMI on SFL and IPC. The observational analysis revealed a strong association between BMI and both PLT and PCT, however the MR estimates did not provide evidence to support this association as causal. Observational analysis using data from a cardiac surgery cohort provided evidence for a positive association between IPC and aggregation induced by adrenaline, TRAP6 and ADP. A summary of these findings is indicated in \@ref(fig:BMI-platelet-cartoon).

The observational and MR analyses in the current chapter provide evidence for a positive association between BMI and both IPC and SFL. Stratifying by NHS BMI category suggested that this estimate is strongest in the overweight category. As IPC is derived using SFL, the measure of mRNA content, these measures are highly correlated. Whilst few studies have explored the direct association between BMI and immature platelet measures, there is some evidence for increased immature platelets in subjects with metabolic syndrome (MS) and subjects with type II diabetes compared with control subjects[@Vaduganathan2008a; @Mijovic2015a]. In these studies, participants with MS or type II diabetes also had a higher BMI, which could be a possible cause of this increase in immature platelets. Indeed, evidence from our analysis suggests that BMI, independent of metabolic syndrome or type II diabetes, may causally influence IPC and SFL.

As IPC is an indirect measure of platelet production[@Lev2016a], these results suggest that an increased BMI may lead to an increased production of platelets. It has been reported that immature platelets have increased thrombotic potential[@Lev2016a; @Grove2011a] and may be predictive of cardiovascular events[@Ibrahim2014; @Freynhofer2017a], suggesting that an increase in the number of immature platelets may be of functional and clinical relevance. A follow-up analysis confirmed that higher IPC was associated with greater platelet aggregation independent of absolute platelet count within a cardiac surgery cohort. Positive associations were found between IPC and aggregation induced by adrenaline, TRAP-6 and ADP, suggesting general platelet hyperactivity with more immature platelets. A previous study in a coronary artery disease cohort also found a positive correlation between IPC and aggregation induced by arachidonic acid, collagen and ADP[@Grove2011a]. These findings suggest that IPC can be used as a proxy for platelet hyperactivity within a cohort with a history of CVD. Measures of immature platelets are currently not considered in the clinic when prescribing antiplatelet therapy, however if a higher immature platelet count is demonstrative of newly produced, hyperactive platelets then this could be important in guiding dosage regimes to ensure sufficient platelet inhibition[@Bernlochner2015a]. Observational studies have also found that patients with COVID-19 have elevated immature platelet counts and fraction, which could partly explain high rates COVID-19 induced thrombosis[@Cohen2020, @Klok2020]. Despite the association between BMI and IPC, there was less evidence for an effect of BMI on IPF. This lack of association may be because IPF is the proportion of immature platelets, therefore if someone had a higher number of immature platelets, but also a higher number of platelets overall (for example due to increased platelet lifespan), there would be no increase in the immature platelet fraction.

In general, previous studies have reported positive observational associations between BMI and both PLT and PCT[@Furuncuoglu2016]. More direct measures of body fat such as total fat mass, waist-hip ratio and waist circumference have also been reported to be positively associated with both PLT and PCT[@Han2018a]; the observational evidence from the current chapter is in agreement with this. The MR analysis did not detect causal effects of BMI on measures of PLT/PCT, however the estimates were consistently positive. It is possible that IPC could be raised in absence of raised PLT as platelets may being produced at an increased rate, but could also be being destroyed at an increased rate. The small P values in the Wu-Hausman test for endogeneity for plateletcrit and platelet count variables support that the observational and MR estimates are different. Estimates could be biased due to confounding factors, reverse causation or other sources of bias. Possible routes of confounding could include stress, inflammation and nutrition, which could exert independent effects on both BMI and platelet count. 

Both observational and MR estimates suggested that BMI is not associated with measures of platelet size, such as MPV and P-LCR. There are conflicting findings in the literature, with some studies suggesting that there is a positive association between BMI and MPV[@Coban2005] and others showing no association[@Furuncuoglu2016; @Han2018a; @Heffron2018]. The results of the current chapter suggest that associations seen previously between BMI and MPV are likely due to confounding of observational estimates. The lack of association between BMI and MPV may be surprising given a correlation coefficient of 0.62 between IPC and MPV.  As BMI was positively associated with immature platelet count, and immature platelets tend to be larger, it may be surprising that BMI was not associated with measures of platelet size. However, immature platelets make up a small percentage of overall platelets (~3-6 %)[@Ibrahim2014; @Bernlochner2015a], therefore the increase in immature platelets may not affect the overall median size of the whole platelet population.

Although this chapter suggests potential effects of BMI on platelet traits such as SFL and IPC, it does not provide mechanistic insight into how BMI exerts these effects. Previous studies have suggested that inflammation driven by adiposity can stimulate megakaryocyte proliferation, thereby increasing platelet numbers[@Han2018a]. There is evidence that inflammatory mediators such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) could be one such factor[@Kaser2001]. Further study would be warranted to explore these mechanisms, as well as replicate the current findings, such as through independent population or clinical studies. 

### Limitations {#INTERVAL-limitations}
There are a few limitations to the analyses presented in this chapter that should be recognised. Firstly, BMI was derived from self-reported height and weight. Although there is potential for this to bias observations, previous studies have found that self-reported BMI and BMI measured in the clinic are strongly associated[@Nikolaou2017]. The GRS also associates with BMI to the extent expected. Secondly, there may be other confounders which were not recorded within INTERVAL and therefore could not be accounted for in our models, such as, socio-economic position, which may affect both BMI and risk of thrombosis. Therefore, residual confounding of observational estimates cannot be ruled out. Whilst the INTERVAL study provided relatively precise estimates of effect overall, larger sample sizes within each BMI category would be required to further investigate potential nonlinearity in the relationship between BMI and IPC. With respect to the observational analysis conducted in COPTIC, the sample size is modest, which may limit power to detect associations. Furthermore, this cohort required cardiac surgery and therefore it is possible that associations found may not be generalizable to the wider population,  as participants also displayed greater aggregatory responses than the reference ranges[@Marcucci2015].  However, these findings do indicate that immature platelets may be a biomarker of platelet hyperactivity in patients with a history of CVD. It is important to note that the anticoagulant used (EDTA) has been reported to affect platelet parameters, such as increasing MPV and decreasing PLT[@Mannuß2020]. Despite this, EDTA is the standard anticoagulant used for full blood counts in the NHS. The Sysmex analyzers used in INTERVAL and COPTIC were different models, however, it has been shown that there is strong association between platelet measures between the XE and newer XN analyzers[@Briggs2012].

Altogether, observational and MR evidence indicate that an increased BMI is associated with an increase in number of immature platelets. Observational evidence indicates that higher immature platelet count is associated with enhanced aggregation in a cardiac surgery cohort. Together, these results indicate that higher BMI may enhance platelet function and thrombosis by increasing platelet production and immature platelet count.
