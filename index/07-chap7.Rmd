# Using a randomised control trial to explore the effects of caloric restriction-induced weight loss on the plasma proteome {#BMI-protein-RCT}

## Background

Obesity is associated with an increased risk of type II diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular diseases, musculoskeletal diseases, and types of cancer [@Garg2014; @Khan2018; @Kortt2002]. These associations are well established, however mechanisms of disease are less clear. It is likely that a change in the composition of proteins circulating in the blood plays a role in obesity-related disease [@Goudswaard2021]. The previous results chapter (Chapter \@ref(BMI-protein-MR)) examined the effect of BMI on the plasma proteome and provided estimates for the average change in proteins per average difference in BMI in a general population, using Mendelian randomization (MR). There was evidence of a BMI effect on proteins such as leptin, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4). A change in circulating levels of these proteins have been implicated in cardiovascular diseases. 

Although MR helps to overcome issues inherent to observational studies such as confounding and reverse causation, MR has its own limitations. For example, it is possible that genetic variants used for the genetic risk score could affect protein levels through routes other than changes in BMI. This is known as horizonal pleiotropy [@Davies2018]. Triangulation can be used in efforts to further determine the BMI effects on the plasma proteome. Triangulation is defined as strengthening causal inference through the combination of study designs which each have separate sources of bias [@Lawlor2016]. Therefore, to complement the Mendelian randomization in the previous chapter, the Diabetes REmission Clinical Trial (DiRECT) can be utilised. The DiRECT trial consisted of a group of patients who had overweight/obesity and T2D who were either given guideline T2D care or an intervention to help with weight loss and T2D remission. This chapter therefore aimed to:

1) Examine the effect of BMI change on the plasma proteome.
2) Compare BMI-protein effects across MR and RCT study designs (Results from Chapter \@ref(BMI-protein-MR)).

## Methods

### Study design and participants
Samples analysed within this study were collected from participants enrolled in the Diabetes Remission clinical trial (DiRECT). DiRECT was a cluster-randomised trial which took place at 49 primary care practices in Scotland and Tyneside [@Lean2018]. Ethics approval was granted from West 3 Ethics Committee (January, 2014) and the National Health Service (NHS). Participants were recruited between 25th July 2014 and 5th August 2016. Details of the protocol have previously been published [@Leslie2016]. Participants enrolled were between 20-65 years, diagnosed with T2D within previous 6 years, had a BMI of between 27-45kg/m^2^. Participants were excluded if they were: using insulin, had a HbA1c concentration of ≥12 % (≥108 mmol/mol), weight loss of >5 kg in the preceding 6 months, an estimated glomerular filtration rate of <30 mL/min per 1.732 m^2^. More exclusion criteria are included in the main trial paper [@Lean2018]. Participants in the control group received best-practice care by guidelines. The intervention group were asked to follow the Counterweright-Plus weight management programme [@Lean2013]. This programme consisted of a total diet replacement (TDR) phase using a low energy diet (825-853 kcal/day) for 3-5 months, followed by structured food reintroduction of 2-8 weeks, with ongoing monthly long-term weight loss maintenance visits. Those in the intervention group had their antidiabetic and antihypertensive drugs discontinued. In total, there were 146 patients in the control group and 119 in the intervention group who remained enrolled in the study at 1 year, as detailed in Figure \@ref(fig:direct-participants).

```

### Included variables
Age and sex were self-reported. Height was measured with the Frankfort plane horizonal with a protable stadiometer (Chasmors Ltd, London). Weight was measured using Class 111 approved calibrated scales (Marsden Group UK). Blood was donated at various timepoints including at baseline (week 0) and at 1 year (week 52), where HDL cholesterol, tryglycerides, HbA1c and plasma glucose were measured. Systolic blood pressure was measured with the patient seated, rested and with legs uncrossed for ≥5 mins. BMI was calculated by dividing the weight (kg) by the square of the height (m). BMI change was calculated by subtracting BMI at baseline from BMI at 1 year. This BMI change was rank normal transformed (function rntransform() from "moosefun" R package https://github.com/hughesevoanth/moosefun/). The centre attended and list size of the practice (>5700 or ≤5700) determined whether participants were allocated to control or intervention and therefore were recorded.
 
### Proteomics
Plasma samples were taken from participants at baseline at and 1-year post-randomisation. Protein detection was performed by the SomaScan assay by SomaLogic. As mentioned before, this technique uses Slow Off-rate Modified Aptamers (SOMAmers) which make direct contact with proteins and quantifies protein levels by using a DNA microarray [@Rohloff2014]. There were 5284 proteins included in the array, of which 4601 proteins passed internal quality control checks. The proteomic data was further cleaned using the "metaboprep" R package [@Hughes2021], with protein levels from both timepoints all QC'd together. This R package identified no extreme missingness, removed outliers based on principal component analyses and calculated the number of independent proteins by using pairwise correlation coefficients between proteins (869 representative proteins). The package also implemented the Shapiro-Wilk test and took the W statistic to identify proteins which have a normal distribution (W≥0.95). Only 399 proteins had W statistics ≥0.95. This data was then log2 transformed to match protein transformation by Sun et al. [@Sun2018] then adjusted for age and sex (data had already undergone technical adjustment). Protein change was calculated for each individual by subtracting the baseline protein levels from protein levels at one-year. These protein change values were rank normal transformed.

### Statistical analysis

Analyses were performed using R version 3.6.1. 

A total of 265 participants were included in the current analysis. Participant baseline characteristics were summarised as the mean and SD. Baseline characteristics were calculated for both control group (N=146) and intervention (N=119) and were compared across groups using either a two-tailed t-test or a Chi^2^ test. 

The association between BMI change and protein change was explored using multiple linear regression adjusting for centre, list size, age and sex (function lm() from base R "stats" package). Due to the nature of linear regression, outputs of regression provide the mean individual change in protein (in SDs) per SD increase in BMI. Therefore if more weight loss reduces the levels of protein, the beta coefficient is positive [@Figarska2020]. The association between potential confounders (age and sex) and both exposure (BMI change) and outcome (protein change) were explored using linear regression. The difference in BMI change in intervention group compared to control was performed using linear regression, adjusting for centre, list size, age and sex. Covariables (age, sex, centre and list size) were compared across treatment groups. Treatment group was therefore used as an instrument for BMI change in a two stage least squares analysis \:ref(fig:direct-tsls) to estimate the effects of BMI change on protein change using ivreg() function from the "AER" R package (https://github.com/cran/AER/blob/master/R/ivreg.R). As a sensitivity analysis, for proteins which associate with BMI change, baseline protein levels were compared across control and intervention groups. P values were adjusted for multiple testing based on the number of representative proteins (0.05/869 = 5.8x10^-5^).

```

Enrichment analysis was performed by xxxxxxxxxx.

BMI change-protein change estimates from the multiple linear regression analyses and two stage least squares analyses were compared using a Deming regression (deming() function from "Deming" R package. Deming regression is a special type of total least squares (TLS) and differs from linear regression (OLS) as it accounts for error in both the x- and y- axes. In efforts to further elucidate which proteins are altered by adiposity, a comparison between the BMI-protein associations in INTERVAL (Chapter \@ref(BMI-protein-MR)) and the BMI change-protein change associations in the current analyses was also performed using a Deming regression. There were 2803 unique proteins overlapping across the two cohorts. Estimates across the two cohorts were compared using a Deming regression. 

## Results

### Participant characteristics

Participants displayed similar characteristics across control and intervention groups (Table \@ref(tab:DiRECT-participants)). Baseline BMI was similar across treatment groups (34.2 kg/m^2^ with SD of 4.3 in the control group vs 35.0 kg/m^2^ with SD of 4.6 in the intervention group, p=0.19). Other variables relating to cariometabolic health were also similar across groups, including systolic blood pressure, HbA1c, glucose and insulin levels. The participants in the intervention group were younger and included fewer participants from Scotland but more from Tyneside.

### Observational association between BMI change and protein change
Linear regression was used to estimate the effect of BMI change on protein change. After adjusting for multiple testing (p<5.8x10^-5^), 254 proteins out of 4601 proteins were associated with BMI change (5.5 % of all protein tested). Although overall there was weight loss and a reduction in BMI, beta coefficients can be interpreted as the change in protein level (SDs) per SD increase in BMI. Negative associations were observed with BMI change and scavenger receptor class A member 5 (SCAR5, -0.62 SDs per SD increase in BMI, 95% CI -0.72 to -0.53 p=3.7x10^-29^) and apolipoprotein F (-0.58 SDs per SD increase in BMI, 95% -0.68 to -0.48, p=1.8x10^-24^). BMI change was positively associated in changes in levels of Proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase receptor Ret (RET) (0.59 SDs increase per SD increase in BMI, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.69 p=1.6x10^-25^), growth hormone receptor (GHR) (0.59 SDs increase per SD increase in BMI, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.69 p=5.8x10^-25^).

### Association between confounders and exposure/outcomes
There was weak evidence for an association between age and BMI change (0.02 SDs increase in BMI change per 1 year, 95 % CIs -0.0003 to 0.034, p=0.054), where an increase in BMI change means that the participant is less likely to reduce their BMI. There was no evidence that sex was associated with BMI change (BMI change 0.073 SDs increase in BMI change in females compared with males, 95 % CI -0.17 to 0.32, p=0.56). Age and sex displayed weak associations with protein changes, but these did not pass multiple testing adjustment.

### Association between treatment group and BMI change
Mean BMI change in all participants was -1.8kg/m^2^ (SD 2.5 kg/m^2^), with a mean change in the control group of -0.4 kg/m^2^ (SD 1.3) vs -3.6kg/m^2^ (SD 2.5) in the intervention. The difference in BMI change comparing intervention to control was -3.2 kg/m^2^ (SE 0.25, p=1.52x10^-29^). These analyses suggest that treatment group is a valid instrument for BMI change.

```

### Two-stage least squares analysis
Treatment group was used as an instrument for BMI change in a two-stage least squares analysis. After adjustment for multiple testing, BMI change was associated with changes in levels of 171 proteins (3.7 %). The protein which showed the strongest association with BMI change was SCAR5 (-0.91 SDs per SD increase in BMI, 95% CI -1.07 to -0.75, p=1.54x10^-23^). Other proteins displayed a positive association with BMI change, including Fatty acid-binding protein, heart (FABP1, 0.86 SDs increase per SD increase in BMI, 95% CI 0.69-1.04, p=6.3x10^-19^). Aminoacyclase-1 was also positively associated with BMI change (0.80 SDs increase in protein per SD increase in BMI, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.97, p=4.9x10^-18^).

### Comparison of observational linear regression and TSLS results for the effect of BMI change on protein change
A total of 110 proteins were only associated within the observational linear regression model, whereas 27 proteins were only associated in the TSLS analysis using treatment group as an instrument for BMI change. 144 proteins were associated with BMI in both analyses (\@ref(fig:circos)), with largest effect estimates across methods for SCAR5, Adiponectin, Apolipoprotein F, growth hormone receptor (GHR), receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatase U (PTPRU) and sex hormone binding globulin. These can be seen in Figure \@ref(fig:scatter-DiRECT).

### Sensitivity analysis
Proteins which were associated with BMI change were compared across control and intervention groups at baseline. There was not strong evidence for any differences in baseline levels of proteins (p<5.8x10^-5^). 

### Enrichment analysis

### Comparison of BMI effects across DiRECT and INTERVAL
BMI-protein estimates from this study were compared with effect estimates from INTERVAL (Chapter \@ref(BMI-protein-MR)). Both cohorts provided evidence for an effect of BMI on a range of proteins. Figure \@ref(fig:DiRECT-INTERVAL) shows the BMI-protein estimates for the proteins which were included in both DiRECT and INTERVAL. There was consistent evidence across both studies for a BMI-increasing effect on proteins including fumarylacetoacetase (FAAA), alcohol dehydrogenase 4 (ADH4), growth hormone receptor (GHR) and carboxypeptidase M (CBPM). Furthermore, higher BMI had a lowering effect on levels of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), as well as insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1/2 (IGFBP1/2).

## Discussion

In this chapter, a clinical trial implementing caloric restriction-induced weight loss was utilised to assess the effect of BMI change on the plasma proteome. 

This analysis provided evidence for a broad effect of weight loss on the plasma proteome. This trial

Table \@ref(tab:weight-loss-protein) provides a summary of findings from the literature from previous studies which have explored the effect of caloric restriction on plasma proteins. As detailed in the table, previous studies have mainly used mass spectrometry. One study used SomaLogic, however this was the panel that
