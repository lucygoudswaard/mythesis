# Discussion

## Overall findings
The work presented in this thesis brought together an interdiscplinary approach to expand on previous literature to further explore the contribution of the plasma proteome and platelet function to obesity-related thrombosis. A summary of pathways explored in each results chapters is displayed in summary Figure \@ref(fig:Thesis-schematic-chaps), with a more detailed summary of findings in Table \@ref(tab:main-thesis-findings).

Within a cardiac surgery cohort (COPTIC), immature platelet count was positively associated with whole blood platelet aggregation.","Laboratory experiments were optimised to assess platelet function from patients. In the clinical pilot study, there was little evidence for an effect of high BMI on platelet function, but there was evidence for a difference in levels of platelet proteins across groups. This study needs to be replicated with a larger N, controlling for confounders.", "This study provided evidence that the chemokines MDC and TARC can potentiate PAR1-AP induced platelet function. The chemokines were also found to be able to activate platelets when applied alone. It is likely that these effects are through the CCR4 receptor which is likely to be Gq coupled. A two sample Mendelian randomization analysis implicated higher levels of MDC in deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism", "Higher BMI has a causal effect on levels of proteins which circulate in the plasma. Proteins most altered by BMI were enriched for cardiovascular disease, metabolic disease and renal disease", "Weight loss as a result of caloric restriction has a substantial effect on the plasma proteome and protein levels altered as a result of higher BMI (Chapter 7) can be reversed with weight loss.")

## Strengths and limitations

## Future studies
Chapter 4
- Replicate BMI and IPC association in another large cohort. 
- Need to be summary stats for larger cohorts with platelet function to do two sample MR for BMI to platelet function.

Chapter 5
- Follow up immature platelets from patients with obesity as not much is understood about their function
- Look up proteins which came up in proteomics in two sample MR? E.g. APMAP implemented in MI.
- Complete the longitudinal study - repeated measures before and after surgery could be informative.

Chapter 6
- Further signaling and functional work required.
- These chemokines were measured within Chapter 7 - there was evidence for an association between BMI and MDC, and weak evidence for a causal effect (p=0.07). This did not pass multiple testing correction. It would be beneficial to look at these chemokines in other cohorts. In the DiRECT analysis, there was weak evidence that a reduction in weight reduces levels of MDC (p=0.06). Again, this did not pass multiple testing. The agreement in direction across the two studies (raised with higher BMI and reduced with weight loss), suggests that this effect could be real, however it may be a relatively small effect which may require more targeted proteomics. The effects were smaller for TARC, suggesting that if these effects are real, body mass index has a larger effect on MDC levels.

Chapter 7
- Recent data suggested nonlinearity with metabolites, preliminary analyses have suggested that effects may be nonlinear (Add a Figure as an appendix - use example of BMI and CRP).

Chapter 8
- Utilise bariatric surgery data as a third line of evidence to explore effect of BMI/weight loss on the plasma proteome. Bring in that this will be performed as part of the transition fellowship.
- Work on proteomic networks to really determine key proteins in disease - this leads onto the transition fellowship.
- Instrument groups of proteins
- Two sample MR of proteins of interest to immature platelet count - .
