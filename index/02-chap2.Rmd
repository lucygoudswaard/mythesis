# Introduction {#background}

## The history of body mass index
Although body fatness (adiposity) has long been associated with adverse health, the use of the term body mass index (BMI), is relatively recent. BMI is thought to have been first defined in 1972 by Ancel Keys[@Blackburn2014]. This term was given to define the ratio of weight in kilograms over the square of the height in metres. This measure was found to reflect overall body fatness well, while being easy and cheap to measure. The World Health Organization first defined the BMI categories [@WHO1995] used today in 1995: the National Health Service (NHS) defines a body mass index (BMI) of 25 kg/m^2^ as having overweight and 30 kg/m^2^ or higher as having obesity. These bounds were chosen based on associations with mortality. The average BMI of the UK adult population is ~27kg/m^2^[@Wade2018], which is in the 'overweight' category. Overweight is also more common than 'normal-weight' in many other higher-income countries[@NCD-RisC2016], and prevalence of overweight is increasing in lower-income countries[@Templin2019]. It is currently estimated that 40% of adults in the United States have obesity, with 26% of the population from the United Kingdom having obesity[@Bluher2019]. As of 2016, the number of individuals globally with obesity surpassed 650 million[@TheLancetPublicHealth2018]. 

## Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of deaths worldwide {#CVD-stats}
Diseases affecting the heart and blood vessels are the major cause of mortality in many countries[@BritishHeartFoundation2021]. In 2019, global deaths from coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke amounted to ~9 million and ~6.5 million deaths, respectively[@BritishHeartFoundation2021]. Current known risk factors for cardiovascular diseases include smoking, a sedentary lifestyle, poor diet and high cholesterol[@Virani2021]. Overweight and obesity are also well established risk factors for such diseases. Obesity leads the years lived with disability and injury risk factors in the United States[@Virani2021]. Studies have found a link between adiposity and cardiovascular risk through a range of study designs. For example, large observational studies have found that adults with overweight or obesity have a higher risk of cardiovascular events and death from cardiovascular disease[@Khan2018]. Another study found that an average increase in BMI of 4 kg/m^2^ across a population increased the odds of ischaemic heart disease by 20-30%[@Nordestgaard2012]. 

## Mendelian randomisation can be used to explore causality
Risk factors have often been identified through observational associations. Observational studies are often limited by bias, confounding and reverse causation[@Davies2018]. Mendelian randomisation (MR) is a technique which exploits the random assortment of alleles to estimate the causal association between a modifiable risk factor and disease outcomes. There are two main types of MR that can performed: one-sample MR and two-sample MR. One-sample MR is used where the exposure and outcome are measured in the same sample, whereas in two-sample MR the SNP-exposure and SNP-outcome estimates are derived from separate populations[@Zheng2019a]. MR can be likened to a natural randomised controlled trial (RCT)[@Gill2020]. This technique is widely implemented due to the availability of genetic data in large cohorts, such as in ~500,000 UK Biobank participants[@Bycroft2018]. An example of how MR and RCTs can be used to determine causality is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:MR-CVevent), using BMI and cardiovascular events as an example[@Doney2009]. Here, genotypes that are associated with BMI can be used. These genotypes should only be associated with BMI and not other confounding factors. If people with genotypes which are associated with higher BMI also have higher rates of cardiovascular events, it is likely that the relationship between BMI and cardiovascular events is causal. Although a useful technique in exploring causality, MR has its own biases and limitations, therefore other lines of evidence and study designs such as RCTs are required. In an RCT, if a weight loss intervention reduces BMI compared to the control group, and also reduces the rate of cardiovascular events, this also supports a causal role of BMI in the onset of cardiovascular events. The RCT is considered gold standard in understanding causality, however these trials are expensive and take a long time due to the time needed to follow up participants.

## The genetics of obesity
As indicated above, Mendelian randomisation can be used to estimate the causal relationship of BMI on various outcomes. There are strong correlations between BMI and more direct measures of fat mass measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)[@Bell2018], such as total fat mass index and regional fat mass indices. Due to the specialised equipment needed for fat mass measures, BMI is often much more widely available within cohort studies, trials and in the clinic. Environmental factors are well known to explain a large amount of variance in BMI, but genetic variants also influence BMI. Monogenic obesity was first identified where mutations in the ob (leptin) gene[@Zhang1994] led to mice having obesity. This was later discovered to be because leptin was secreted by adipose tissue and was found to influence food consumption[@Friedman1998]. The first genome-wide association study (GWAS) for obesity traits was performed in 2007 for around 5,000 individuals[@Scuteri2007], which found evidence that 10 SNPs were associated with BMI. Since then, GWAS have been performed in increasingly larger cohort sizes[@Locke2015], with the largest and most recent GWAS performed in 2018 by Yengo et al.[@Yengo2018]. This GWAS found 941 near-independent genetic variants which associate with BMI. These have been shown to explain around 6% of the variance in BMI. Of these SNPs, 656 are considered as primary associations[@Yengo2018].

## Types of CVD
As indicated in section \@ref(CVD-stats), CHD and stroke affect millions of people worldwide every year. CVD is used as a term to describe the group of diseases which affect the heart or blood vessels. Within CVD there are various diseases which range in their clinical presentation and pathology. CHD (also referred to as coronary artery disease (CAD) or ischaemic heart disease (IHD)) is caused by a build up of plaques in the arteries (atherosclerosis). These plaques are caused by low density lipoproteins (LDLs) accumulating in the intima of the arteries, where they undergo oxidation[@Bentzon2014]. This then activates immune response and macrophages and lymphocytes also accumulate within the intima[@Badimon2012]. The plaques build in size and may eventually rupture the endothelium of the artery, initiating platelet activation and thrombus formation (arterial thrombosis, Figure \@ref(fig:thrombi-cartoon)A), thereby causing a heart attack. Other types of CVD include stroke, which can be either ischaemic (another form of arterial thrombosis) or haemorrhagic. Arterial thrombi are estimated to be composed of 31% platelets[@Chernysh2020].

Thrombi can also form in veins (venous thromboembolism/VTE), thereby causing deep venous thrombosis (DVT) when the thrombus is in the legs or pulmonary embolism when an embolus becomes lodged in the lungs. Unlike arterial thrombi, venous thrombi form low shear rates[@Koupenova2017a]. DVT is thought to start in the legs close to the valves as these are areas of stasis and hypoxia[@Esmon2009; @Stone2017]. This slowing of the blood reduces oxygen tension and increases haematocrit[@Stone2017]. The stasis and hypoxia also lead to downregulation of anticaogulant proteins such as thrombomodulin and endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR)[@Stone2017] and an upregulation of procoagulant proteins such as the adhesion molecule P-selectin. Venous thrombi mainly consist of a red cell dense fibrous clot (Figure \@ref(fig:thrombi-cartoon)B). Despite not as highly present in venous thrombi as arterial thrombi, platelets still play a role and form an inner layer of the thrombus[@Stone2017].

## Higher BMI has a causal effect on ischaemic heart disease
Studies which have used MR to estimate a causal effect have indicated that BMI may have an even greater effect on IHD than observational studies suggested. Nordestgaard et al. utilised single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) which are associated with BMI to estimate that 4kg/m^2^ higher BMI increases the odds of IHD by as much as 52%[@Nordestgaard2012]. Other studies which have used more specific measures of adiposity, such as waist hip ratio adjusted for BMI (WHRadjBMI), have also found evidence for a causal effect of adiposity on coronary heart disease risk[@Dale2017]. Further, higher BMI has been shown to have a causal relationship with more specific measures of cardiovascular events such as ischaemic stroke[@Harshfield2021]. A separate line of evidence for a causal effect of BMI on cardiovascular outcomes is that more weight loss after bariatric surgery reduces the occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE)[@Jimenez2021]. A meta-analysis of bariatric surgery on cardiovascular outcomes also found that bariatric surgery reduces myocardial infarction and stroke compared with non-surgical controls[@vanVeldhuisen2022]. Despite evidence for causal relationships, changes which occur as a result of BMI which lead to these cardiovascular events are unclear.

## How does higher BMI cause increased risk of CHD?
There is extensive evidence that higher BMI causes hypertension and type 2 diabetes (T2D), which contribute to the increased risk of a heart attack or a stroke. As well as this, studies which have explored the molecular footprint of adiposity have tended to focus on the lipidome, such as cholesterol and triglycerides in lipoprotein subtypes, including low-density lipoproteins (LDL), very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) and high-density lipoproteins (HDL)[@Bell2018a; @Wurtz2014], where a higher BMI is associated with an increase in LDLs and a decrease in large HDLs. This has been explored in a causal framework. LDLs are therefore an important example of circulating molecules which are causally related to both BMI and disease risk. Although LDLs are important in mediating the increased risk of CHD[@Lu2014], this does not account for all the risk. Therefore, it is likely that there are other factors which circulate that are mediating this association. There are thousands of detectable proteins which circulate in the blood[@Sun2018], which have a range of roles from inflammation to coagulation. It is likely that adiposity causes an alteration in such proteins, which may have a downstream effect on platelet function and cardiovascular risk. Assessing the overall protein profile of adiposity may provide more of a mechanistic insight into how adiposity causes disease and identify druggable targets.

## Platelets are key cells in thrombosis
Platelets are anucleate cells which are generated from megakaryocytes in the bone marrow. Platelets are one of the key cells involved in haemostasis[@Rivera2009]. Under normal conditions, the endothelium releases nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin I2 (PGI2) which suppress platelet activation[@Yau2015]. When the endothelium is damaged, platelets adhere to the injured vessel wall through the glycoprotein Ib-IX-V (GPIb-IX-V) receptor and the glycoprotein VI (GPVI) collagen receptor. As a result, platelets secrete alpha and dense granules and undergo shape change[@Badimon2012]. Alpha granules release growth factors (e.g. IGF-1), clotting factors and chemokines[@Gear2003], whereas dense granules release molecules such as adenosine diphosphate (ADP), which further activate platelets by interacting with the P2Y~1~ and P2Y~12~ platelet receptors. Integrins are heterodimeric transmembrane glycoprotein complexes, which are important in platelet activation[@Durrant2017a]. One of the main integrins for platelet activation is integrin α~IIb~β~3~[@Huang2019], of which there are 50,000-100,000 integrins per resting platelet. Under resting conditions, integrin α~IIb~β~3~ adopts a low affinity state. Binding of agonists such as thrombin (or the synthetic peptide agonist PAR1-AP/TRAP-6) to the protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) results in activation of integrin α~IIb~β~3~. This is known as inside-out signalling. Here, inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol are generated, which leads to an increase in cytosolic calcium (Ca^2+^). This in turn activates CALDAG-GEF1 as well as protein kinase C (PKC)[@Mehrbod2013]. The small GTPase, Rap1 is then activated which recruits proteins such as talin and kindlin[@Durrant2017]. This leads to a change in conformation to increase the affinity of integrin α~IIb~β~3~ for its ligand, fibrinogen[@Huang2019]. Neighbouring platelets then become activated due to the release of local mediators such as ADP and thromboxane A~2~ (TxA~2~, which acts at the TP receptor)[@Offermanns2006]. Subsequent fibrinogen binding results in cross-linking of activated platelets (platelet aggregation) via integrin α~IIb~β~3~, resulting in the cessation of bleeding[@Rivera2009]. These key platelet agonists and receptors are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:platelet-activation-receptors). Despite these processes being essential for haemostasis, when platelets become hyperactive, the balance is tipped in favour of thrombosis following plaque rupture. This can cause a myocardial infarction and stroke.

## Platelets are therapeutic targets for thrombosis
When a patient has a clot in one of the coronary arteries, they often undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), which consists of inserting a catheter in order to place a stent to open up the occluded space. Following this, patients are commonly prescribed dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT)[@Freynhofer2017a; @Nardin2015] and anticoagulants, which have been shown to reduce occurrence of future myocardial infarction[@Khan2020]. DAPT generally consists of aspirin which inhibits the enzyme cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) in platelets, resulting in a blockade of production of TxA~2~[@Warner2011], and a P2Y~12~ antagonist such as clopidogrel or ticagrelor[@Degrauwe2017]. Together, these therapies attenuate platelet activation. The coagulation system results in conversion of fibrinogen to an insoluble fibrin rich platelet plug, therefore it is a close regulator of platelet function. Anticoagulants are therefore also an effective therapy for the prevention and recurrence of thrombosis[@Grover2019]. Although these treatments are effective in many patients, myocardial infarction still recurs in some patients and it is not possible to predict which individuals will not respond to treatment. Finding the right dosage of antiplatelet drugs in preventing thrombosis while also preventing major bleeding is also difficult[@Mullen2021].

As BMI is associated with increased rates of thrombotic events and platelets are one of the key cells involved in thrombosis, it is possible that high BMI causes platelet hyperactivity. Various studies have attempted to address this question. There is mixed evidence for an effect of BMI on platelet hyperactivity. For example, in patients who were treated with clopidogrel there was a positive association between BMI and platelet activation in response to the agonist ADP[@Nardin2015]. Studies looking at BMI and platelet function are often limited by small sample sizes and are often restricted to patients who are taking antiplatelet drugs[@Deharo2014; @Sibbing2007; @Pankert2014]. Less is known about the association between BMI and platelet function in the absence of antiplatelet therapies. To directly address this, there is a need for a cohort of participants where there is information about BMI, potential circulating intermediates and platelet function. Genetic data would also help address the directionality of the effect. As this is currently not all available within a large cohort, separate cohorts are required to explore different associations.

## Experimental techniques to measure platelet function {#platelet-function-techniques}
Platelet function can be measured by various laboratory techniques and are useful at characterising features of normal platelet function, and how pltelet function may be changed in certain disease states. Light transmission aggregometry (LTA) quantifies platelet aggregation by how much light passes through the sample. The more aggregation, the clearer the solution and the more light passes through and is detected[@Born1962]. LTA is considered the gold standard, however there are other techniques which can measure platelet aggregation. Plate aggregation uses the same principles as LTA, however a 96 well plate is used instead of using larger cuvettes, along with a plate reader[@Chan2018]. This allows less sample and therefore more conditions to be assessed, thereby allowing full concentration response curves to be derived using various platelet agonists. More recent techniques have been developed which utilise electrodes to quantify aggregation such as Multiple Electrode Aggregometry (MEA)[@Toth2006]. This technique uses four electrodes and measures aggregation in whole blood by using impedance aggregometry. The readings from MEA, unlike LTA, are more affected by the platelet count, where a higher platelet count causes more aggregation[@Toth2006].

Other techniques routinely used include using flow cytometry. Measuring resting levels of receptors using fluorescently labelled antibodies provides information about the function of the platelet[@Hu2017]. Some receptors change conformation and become exposed in response to platelet agonists (such as the integrin α~IIb~β~3~). The adhesion receptor P-selectin is stored in α-granules and becomes rapidly expressed on the platelet plasma membrane in response to agonist stimulation. Such platelet agonists include protease-activating receptor activating peptide 1 (PAR1-AP), adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and collagen-related peptide (CRP). Another technique which can provide useful information about platelets is measuring calcium mobilisation by using a fluorescent calcium indicator. Activation of various receptors causes downstream activation of phospholipase C (PLC). In turn, PLC produces inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP~3~), thereby releasing calcium from the intracellullar stores via IP~3~ receptors (IP~3~-R) in the endoplasmic reticulum[@Varga-Szabo2009]. Another marker of platelet activation and coagulation is phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure. Under basal conditions, PS is mainly present in the inner leaflet of the phospholipid bilayer. Upon activation (e.g. by dual stimulation using collagen and thrombin), the PS becomes exposed on the outer surface of the membrane, thereby providing a binding site for factor Xa (FXa) and thus fibrin formation[@Bevers1983]. Changes in PS exposure can be measured using a fluorescently labelled antibody.

(ref:caption-platelet-diagram-background) **Cartoon of integrin α~IIb~β~3~ activation, P-selectin expression and platelet-leukocyte interactions.** Upon platelet activation by a strong agonist such as CRP, the integrin α~IIb~β~3~ exposes its binding site for fibrinogen and cross-links platelets. P-selectin is expressed in the membrane of alpha granules within platelets. Upon platelet activation, alpha granules fuse with the membrane and P-selectin is then expressed on the outer membrane. P-selectin on platelets can bind to P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) on leukocytes. Figure made using BioRender.com.

include_graphics(path = "figure/Bariatric_study/Platelet_activiation_integrin_p-selectin.png", dpi = NA)
```

As well as platelets aggregating to one another, platelets are also able to bind to leukocytes such as neutrophils. These interactions are important for neutrophil localization for inflammatory responses, leukocyte phagocytosis, generation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) as well as in the activation of coagulation[@Lisman2018]. When activated, platelets express P-selectin. Neutrophils express P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1)[@Zarbock2007] (Figure \@ref(fig:platelet-activation-background)), the receptor for P-selectin, therefore these cells can form aggregates through these adhesion receptors. The extent of these interactions can also be used to measure platelet activation. This can be done under basal conditions or after stimulation with an agonist such as CRP. Firstly, neutrophils are gated based on their side scatter (SSC) and using an antibody for the leukocyte common antigen (CD45)[@Gerrits2016]. An antibody for the platelet receptor CD41 (integrin α~IIb~) is then used to detect the proportion of neutrophils bound to platelets. 

Techniques such as Western Blotting can be used to quantify the levels of total protein or phosphoprotein. This can therefore be used to explore changes in signalling in platelets under basal conditions, or after stimulation with agonists or antagonists. PGE1 acts at a G~s~-coupled prostaglandin G protein coupled receptor (GPCR), which activates adenylyl cyclase and leads to subsequent production of cAMP[@Braune2020]. Protein kinase A (PKA) subsequently phosphorylates the vasodilator-stimulator phosphoprotein (VASP) at sites including Ser^157^ and Ser^239^[@Hezard2005]. Phosphorylation of VASP has been shown to inhibit integrin α~IIb~β~3~ activation, thereby suppressing platelet activity[@Horstrup1994]. The P2Y~12~ receptor is coupled to G~i/o~, therefore the P2Y~12~ agonist ADP opposes the effects of PGE1. Measuring phosphorylation of VASP at these sites is used as an indicator of how well P2Y~12~ antagonists are inhibiting platelets. The inability to reduce PGE1-mediated VASP phosphorylation by ADP indicates more inhibition by drugs such as clopidogrel and ticagrelor[@Hezard2005].

Western blotting requires a lot of material and is limited by the number of proteins/phosphoproteins that can be detected at once. A solution to this issue is using Mass Spectrometry (MS). Using this method, platelets that have been isolated from blood are washed in a buffer and are lysed before MS analysis. Proteins are fragmented into peptides which are then ionised before being captured by the mass spectrometer. Computational methods are required to interpret the peaks of the spectra and to determine proteins present[@Wang2013]. This method enables detection of thousands of platelet proteins[@Huang2021], therefore providing extensive detail of the platelet protein environment. 

## Platelet traits as proxies for platelet function
Although there are not many large studies directly exploring platelet function, other measures of platelet characteristics are widely used in the clinic and among cohort studies. These charactertics are often reported as part of a routine full blood count. These include platelet count (PLT, absolute number of platelets), plateletcrit (PCT, the volume occupied by platelets), mean platelet volume (MPV, a measurement of the average size of platelets) and platelet distribution width (PDW, a measure of how similar platelets are in size)[@Budak2016]. These are often used as diagnostic tools, for example a low platelet count is demonstrative of thrombocytopenia and a high platelet count is known as thrombocytosis/thrombocythaemia. Platelet traits have also been implicated in CVD: there is MR evidence that higher PLT contributes to the risk of ischaemic stroke[@Gill2018], thereby suggesting that these platelet parameters have functional and clinical relevance. There is also evidence that alterations in these parameters associate with platelet function. For example, higher platelet count has been shown to associate with increased platelet aggregation[@Wurtz2012; @Femia2013]. Previous studies have explored the association between BMI and platelet parameters. Some studies have found evidence for an association between BMI and both platelet count and mean platelet volume, however other studies have lacked evidence for an effect[@Furuncuoglu2016; @Han2018a; @Coban2005; @Heffron2018]. These observational studies may be subject to confounding, bias and reverse causation, therefore it is unclear whether there is a causal effect of BMI on these platelet traits, or whether effects are due to other factors. 

More recent haematology analysers such as the Sysmex XN series analysers can provide additional information about platelet structure. They use a combination of fluorescence and impedence flow cyotemtry. Additional readouts provided by these analyzers include immature platelet count (IPC, the number of immature platelets) as well as immature platelet fraction (IPF, the fraction of platelets which are immature), based on a gating of their forward scatter (FSC, size) and side fluorescence (SFL, an indicator of mRNA content)[@UnayDemirel2018a]. An example of detection of PLT and IPF by flow cytometry is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:sysmex-ipf)[@Corpataux2020]. Immature platelets, or reticulated platelets, are the youngest platelets in circulation. They persist for between 24 and 36 hours[@Corpataux2020]. Immature platelets are larger in size and have more mRNA than older circulating platelets. Over time the mRNA degrades and they gradually decrease in size. There are various studies which have suggested that a larger number of immature platelets may increase the risk of suffering from major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE)[@Ibrahim2014]. This suggests that immature platelets may be more reactive than older circulating platelets.

## Platelet primers
Platelets express receptors for various circulating molecules. Previous studies have reported that a range of soluble ligands, growth factors and cytokines which can enhance platelet function are elevated in obesity[@Maury2010a]. These ‘platelet primers’ include insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)[@Frystyk1995; @Hers2007] and thrombopoietin (TPO)[@Blair2015; @Pasquet2000]. There is evidence other molecules such as chemokines may be able to activate platelets. The C-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) receptor is activated by the chemokines macrophage derived chemokine (MDC/CCL22) and thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC/CCL17)[@Kowalska2000; @Abi-Younes2001]. There is observational evidence that higher BMI is positively associated with circulating levels of MDC[@Kitahara2014]. These chemokines are important for chemotaxis of leukocytes. It has also been observed that these chemokines can activate platelets as measured in platelet aggregation and calcium mobilisation experiments[@Abi-Younes2001]. It is unclear how these chemokines are able to exert effects. Known platelet primers (e.g. TPO) potentiate platelet activation through activation of the lipid kinase phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway[@Blair2015; @Pasquet2000]. This activation leads to recruitment of PH-domain proteins including protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) to the plasma membrane among other downstream regulators. PKB is subsequently phosphorylated on Threonine^308^ and Serine^473^ residues leading to its activation[@Hemmings2015]. Another pathway that has been implicated in platelet priming effects is the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. TPO can enhance thromboxane A~2~ (TxA~2~) synthesis through increasing the activation of extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK2)[@Ezumi1998; @VanWilligen2000]. It is possible that these pathways are also important in signalling via CCR4.

## Mechanisms of obesity-related alterations in platelet function
It is not fully understood whether a high BMI leads to a change in platelet function, and if it does, what mechanisms are involved. Inflammatory mediators could be one such mechanism due to likely interactions between inflammatory mediators and platelets in the blood. Obesity commonly presents with a state of low-grade chronic inflammation. There are two types of fat: white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT). WAT secretes proteins and peptides which have pro-inflammatory effects[@Cercato2019; @Kern2001]. There is evidence that obesity is associated with increases in interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), therefore supporting a pro-inflammatory state[@Esser2014]. Previous studies have also identified a causal link between higher BMI and higher circulating levels of the inflammatory molecule C-reactive protein (CRP)[@Timpson2011] and leptin[@Zaghlool2021], further suggesting these effects are BMI driven. More recent studies have used MR and have found an effect of BMI on a range of cytokines[@Kalaoja2021]. As platelet activation can be modified by inflammatory mediators and there is evidence for a causal relationship between BMI and CRP/cytokines, it is likely that inflammation could mediate this effect.

## The role of circulating platelet primers and disease
Recent studies have used large cohorts of people to identify SNPs which are associated with changes in levels of certain proteins. These are known as protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL)[@Sun2018]. Sun et al. identified 1,927 genetic associations with 1,478 proteins. As a result of these pQTLs, there have been numerous studies that have been able to estimate causal effects of proteins in disease by using two sample MR. For a two sample MR, the exposure are measured in a separate cohort from the cohort of the outcome. An example of this is linking the interleukin-6 receptor (IL6R) to diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and coronary artery disease[@Bretherick2020]. The chemokines MDC and TARC both have SNPs which are associated with their levels[@Sun2018]. MDC and TARC have been implicated in platelet hyperactivity, however it is unknown whether raised levels of MDC and TARC would have clinical implications such as a role in ischaemic heart disease. As a polymorphism in the receptor for MDC and TARC (CCR4 receptor) has been implicated in myocardial infarction[@Noori2018], it is important to see how raised levels of MDC and TARC would relate to CVD outcomes. 

## Evaluating the circulating proteome may reveal mechanistic insight into obesity-related diseases
Through literature searches, there is evidence for an association between BMI and chemokines such as MDC and TARC[@Kitahara2014]. Based on these observations, there may be many more circulating proteins which may be raised in obesity and have downstream effects on platelet function. Many studies so far have had hypothesis driven approaches when looking at the effect of BMI on circulating protein levels[@Timpson2011]. This is due to the often limited range of the number of proteins detected in laboratory assays, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Recent technologies have now been developed which allow protein detection in unprecedented scope and detail, for example the SOMAscan by SomaLogic[@Gold2012]. This array can detect around 4000 unique proteins using SOMAmers (Slow Off-rate Modified Aptamers), that are specific for individual proteins and allow quantification using a DNA microarray. Studies that have attempted to characterise the plasma proteome of higher BMI have often only been in an observational framework[@Cominetti2018]. As the majority of druggable targets are proteins, it is valuable to explore the effects of BMI on circulating plasma proteins. It is estimated that 25% of proteins in the human proteome circulate in the blood[@Imming2006], including enzymes, cytokines and transport proteins. Therefore, focusing on effects of adiposity on the circulating proteome may allow for the development of or repurposing of therapeutic interventions to reduce obesity-related disease. To explore the link between BMI, circulating proteins and platelet function, the blood is the tissue of interest. Many studies have blood/plasma/serum samples analysed from participants, therefore enabling exploration of a range of blood measures.

## Importance of interdisciplinary methods
To understand mechanisms of disease, various study designs are required. Each experimental approach used when testing hypotheses has biases and limitations. For example, using basic science it is possible to explore mechanistic effects _in vitro_, _in vivo_ or _ex vivo_, which is crucial. However, it is often difficult to fully understand how findings might translate in a clinical setting. Similarly, observational studies can provide useful clinical information, but these can generally only be used to identify correlation, not causation. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are considered the gold standard way to determine efficacy and causality, especially in drug trials, however these trials are often time consuming and expensive[@Bennett2017]. To overcome this issue, MR utilises genetic information to be able to provide causal estimates. MR is widely utilised since the cost of sequencing genomes has become more affordable. However, this technique requires large sample sizes and can also suffer from issues such as horizontal pleiotropy (where the genetic instrument affects the outcome through routes other than changes in the exposure). Therefore, a combination of laboratory experiments, observational clinical studies, RCTs and MR can therefore help to provide separate sources of evidence in investigating mechanisms of disease and can account for their separate limitations.

## Thesis aims 
It is well established that patients with obesity have an increased risk of CVD, however, the underlying mechanism is still largely unknown. In this study I hypothesise that an increase in BMI alters the plasma proteome leading to enhanced platelet activity and CVD. To test this hypothesis, I will explore the relationship between BMI, the plasma proteome, platelets and CVD, using a multidisciplinary approach. The overall hypothesis is displayed in Figure \@ref(fig:Thesis-schematic). This schematic will be referred to within each chapter in order to highlight which parts of the pathway the chapter aims to address.

The specific sub-aims of the thesis are:

1) Explore the effect of BMI on platelet traits, platelet function and signalling.
2) Characterise the effects of the chemokines macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC) and thymus and activation regulated chemokine (TARC) on platelet function.
3) Determine the effects of adiposity on the plasma proteome and the potential contribution to platelet function.

## Thesis structure
To address the thesis aims, there will be six results chapters in this thesis:

1) Using observational and MR frameworks to determine the effect of body mass index on platelet characteristics (Chapter \@ref(BMI-platelets-INTERVAL))
2) The effect of obesity on platelet function: a clinical study (Chapter \@ref(BMI-platelets-clinic))
3) Pathways linking plasma proteins and platelet function: do the chemokines MDC and TARC play a role? (Chapter \@ref(chemokine-platelets))
4) Exploring the plasma proteome as a link between adiposity and platelet function: Observational and Mendelian randomisation estimates (Chapter \@ref(BMI-protein-MR))
5) Further elucidating the effect of adiposity on the plasma proteome using a weight loss intervention (Chapter \@ref(BMI-protein-RCT))
6) Combining MR and an RCT to determine effects of adiposity on the plasma proteome. (Chapter \@ref(Comparison-proteome))
