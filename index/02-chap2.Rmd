# Background {#background}
This chapter will give a more extensive introduction to the themes covered within the results chapters. It will set out where the current gaps are in the literature and provide an overview of the aims and hypotheses of the thesis.

## The history of body mass index
Although body fatness (adiposity) has long been associated with adverse health, the use of the term body mass index (BMI), is relatively recent. BMI is thought to have been first defined in 1972 by Ancel Keys[@Blackburn2014]. This term was given to define the ratio of weight in kilograms over the square of the height in metres. This measure was found to reflect overall body fatness well, while being easy and cheap to measure. The World Health Organization first defined the BMI categories in 1995[@WHO1995] used today: the National Health Service (NHS) defines a body mass index (BMI) of 25 kg/m^2^ as having overweight and 30 kg/m^2^ or higher as having obesity. These bounds were chosen based on associations with mortality. The average BMI of the UK adult population is ~27kg/m^2^[@Wade2018], which is in the 'overweight' category. Overweight is also more common than 'normal-weight' in many other higher-income countries[@NCD-RisC2016], and prevalence of overweight is increasing in lower-income countries[@Templin2019]. It is currently estimated that 40% of adults in the United States and 26% of adults in the United Kingdom have obesity[@Bluher2019]. As of 2016, the number of individuals globally with obesity surpassed 650 million[@TheLancetPublicHealth2018]. 

## Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of deaths worldwide {#CVD-stats}
Diseases affecting the heart and blood vessels are the major cause of mortality in many countries[@BritishHeartFoundation2021]. In 2019, global deaths from coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke amounted to ~9 million and ~6.5 million deaths, respectively[@BritishHeartFoundation2021]. Current known risk factors for such diseases include smoking, physical inactivity, poor diet and high cholesterol[@Virani2021]. Overweight and obesity are also well established risk factors for such diseases and are now considered the leading years lived with disability and injury risk factors in the United States[@Virani2021]. Various studies have found a link between adiposity and cardiovascular risk through various study designs. For example, large observational studies have found that adults with overweight or obesity have a higher risk of cardiovascular events and death from cardiovascular disease[@Khan2018]. Another study found that an average increase in BMI of 4 kg/m^2^ across a population increased the odds of ischaemic heart disease by 20-30%[@Nordestgaard2012]. 

## Mendelian randomisation can be used to explore causality
Risk factors have often been identified through observational associations. Observational studies are often limited by bias, confounding and reverse causation[@Davies2018]. Mendelian randomisation (MR) is a technique which exploits the random assortment of alleles to estimate the causal association between a modifiable risk factor and disease outcomes. It can be likened to a natural randomised control trial (RCT)[@Gill2020]. This technique is widely implemented due to the availability of genetic data in large cohorts, such as in ~500,000 UK Biobank participants[@Bycroft2018]. An example of how MR and RCTs can be used to determine causality is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:MR-statins), using low density lipoproteins-cholesterol (LDL-C) and cardiovascular events as an example[@Bennett2017]. Here, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with levels of LDL-C can be used. These SNPs should also not be associated with other confounding factors such as smoking. If people with SNPs which are associated with lower LDL-C also have lower rates of cardiovascular events, it is likely that the relationship between LDL-C and cardiovascular events is causal. Although a useful technique in exploring causality, MR has its own biases and limitations, therefore other lines of evidence and study designs such as RCTs are required.

## The genetics of obesity
Mendelian randomization can therefore also be used to estimate the causal relationship of BMI on various outcomes. There are strong correlations between BMI and more direct measures of fat mass measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)[@Bell2018], such as total fat mass index and regional fat mass indices. Due to the specialised equipment needed for fat mass measures, BMI is often much more widely available within cohort studies, trials and in the clinic. Environmental factors are well known to explain a large amount of variance in BMI, but genetic variants also influence BMI. Monogenic obesity was first identified where mutations in the ob (leptin) gene[@Zhang1994] lead to mice having obesity. The first genome-wide association study (GWAS) for obesity traits was performed in 2007 for around 5,000 individuals[@Scuteri2007], which found evidence that 10 SNPs were associated with BMI. Since then, GWAS have been performed in increasingly larger cohort sizes[@Locke2015], with the largest and most recent GWAS performed in 2018 by Yengo et al.[@Yengo2018]. This GWAS found 941 near-independent genetic variants which associate with BMI. These have been shown to explain around 6% of the variance in BMI. Of these SNPs, 656 are considered as primary associations[@Yengo2018].

## Types of cardiovascular disease
As indicated in section \@ref(CVD-stats), CHD and stroke affect millions of people worldwide every year. Cardiovascular disease is used as a term to describe the group of diseases which affect the heart or blood vessels. Within cardiovascular disease there are various diseases which range in their clinical presentation and pathology. CHD (also known as coronary artery disease (CAD) or ischaemic heart disease (IHD)) is caused by a build up of plaques in the arteries (atherosclerosis). These build ups can lead to blockages in the arteries (arterial thrombosis), thereby causing a heart attack. Other types of cardiovascular disease include stroke, which can be either ischaemic (another form of arterial thrombosis) or haemorrhagic. Thrombi can also form in veins (venous thromboembolism/VTE), thereby causing deep venous thrombosis (DVT) when the thrombus is in the legs or pulmonary embolism when it is in the lungs. Arterial and venous thrombi both are composed of platelets, however arterial thrombosis has a much higher proportion (31%)[@Chernysh2020]. Although not one of the main components of venous thrombi, platelets are still involved in the pathology[@Koupenova2017a].

## Higher BMI has a causal effect on ischaemic heart disease
Studies which have used MR to estimate a causal effect have indicated that BMI may have an even greater effect on IHD than observational studies suggested. Nordestgaard et al. utilised single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) which are associated with BMI to estimate that 4kg/m^2^ higher BMI increases the odds of IHD by as much as 52%[@Nordestgaard2012]. Other studies which have used more specific measures of adiposity, such as waist hip ratio adjusted for BMI (WHRadjBMI), have also found evidence for a causal effect of adiposity on coronary heart disease risk[@Dale2017]. Further, higher BMI has been shown to have a causal relationship with more specific measures of cardiovascular events such as ischaemic stroke[@Harshfield2021]. A separate line of evidence for a causal effect of BMI on cardiovascular outcomes is that more weight loss after bariatric surgery reduces the occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE)[@Jimenez2021]. Despite evidence for causal relationships, changes which occur as a result of BMI which lead to these cardiovascular events are unclear.

## How does higher BMI cause increased risk of CHD?
There is extensive evidence that higher BMI causes hypertension and T2D, which contribute to the increased risk of a heart attack or a stroke. As well as this, studies which have explored the molecular footprint of adiposity have tended to focus on the lipidome, such as cholesterol and triglycerides in lipoprotein subtypes, including low-density lipoproteins (LDL), very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) and high-density lipoproteins (HDL)[@Bell2018a; @Wurtz2014], where a higher BMI is associated with an increase in LDLs and a decrease in large HDLs. This has been explored in a causal framework. LDLs are therefore an important example of circulating molecules which are causally related to both BMI and disease risk. Although LDLs are important in mediating the increased risk of CHD[@Lu2014], this does not account for all the risk. Therefore, it is likely that there are other factors which circulate that are mediating this association. There are thousands of detectable proteins which circulate in the blood[@Sun2018], which have a range of roles from inflammation to coagulation. It is likely that adiposity causes an alteration in such proteins, which may have a downstream effect on platelet function and cardiovascular risk. Assessing the overall protein profile of adiposity may provide more of a mechanistic insight into how adiposity causes disease and identify druggable targets.

## Platelets are key cells in thrombosis
Platelets are anucleate cells which are generated from megakaryocytes in the bone marrow. Platelets are one of the key cells involved in haemostasis[@Rivera2009]. Under normal conditions, the endothelium releases nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin I2 (PGI2) which suppress platelet activation[@Yau2015]. When the endothelium is damaged, platelets adhere to the injured vessel wall through the glycoprotein Ib-IX-V (GPIb-IX-V) receptor and the glycoprotein VI (GPVI) collagen receptor. As a result, platelets secrete alpha and dense granules and undergo shape change[@Badimon2012]. Alpha granules release growth factors (e.g. IGF-1), clotting factors and chemokines[@Gear2003], whereas dense granules release molecules such as adenosine diphosphate (ADP), which further activate platelets by interacting with the P2Y1 and P2Y12 platelet receptors. Integrins are heterodimeric transmembrane glycoprotein complexes, which are important in platelet activation[@Durrant2017a]. Binding of agonists such as thrombin (or the synthetic peptide agonist PAR1-AP/TRAP-6) to the protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) results in activation of the integrin α~IIb~β~3~. This is known as inside-out signalling. Here, inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol are generated, which leads to an increase in cytosolic calcium (Ca^2+^). This in turn activates CALDAG-GEF1 as well as protein kinase C (PKC)[@Mehrbod2013]. The small GTPase, Rap1 is then activated which recruits proteins such as talin and kindlin[@Durrant2017]. Subsequent fibrinogen binding results in platelet aggregation, thrombus formation and cessation of bleeding[@Rivera2009]. These key platelet receptors are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:platelet-activation-receptors). Despite these processes being essential for haemostasis, when platelets become hyperactive, the balance is tipped in favour of thrombosis. This can cause a myocardial infarction and stroke.

## Platelets are therapeutic targets for thrombosis
When a patient has a clot in one of the coronary arteries, they often undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), which consists of inserting a catheter in order to place a stent to open up the occluded space. Following this, patients are commonly prescribed dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT)[@Freynhofer2017a; @Nardin2015] and anticoagulants, which have been shown to reduce occurrence of future myocardial infarction[@Khan2020]. DAPT is generally consists of aspirin (cyclo-oxygenase-1 inhibitor) and a P2Y~12~ antagonist such as clopidogrel or ticagrelor [@Degrauwe2017]. Although effective in many patients, myocardial infarction recurs in some patients. As BMI is associated with increased rates of thrombotic events and platelets are one of the key cells involved in thrombosis, it is possible that high BMI causes platelet hyperactivity. Various studies have attempted to address this question. There is mixed evidence for an effect of BMI on platelet hyperactivity. For example, in patients who were treated with clopidogrel there was a positive association between BMI and platelet activation in response to the agonist ADP[@Nardin2015]. Studies looking at BMI and platelet function are often limited by small sample sizes and are often restricted to patients being on antiplatelet therapy[@Deharo2014; @Sibbing2007; @Pankert2014]. Less is known about the association between BMI and platelet function in the absence of antiplatelet therapies. To address this, there needs to be a cohort which has information about BMI, potential circulating intermediates and platelet function. Genetic data would also help address the directionality of the effect. As this is currently not all available within a large cohort, separate cohorts are required to explore different associations.

## Experimental techniques to measure platelet function {#platelet-function-techniques}
Platelet function can be measured by various laboratory techniques. Light transmission aggregometry (LTA) quantifies aggregation by how much light passes through the sample. The more aggregation, the clearer the solution and the more light passes through and is detected. Other techniques commonly used include using fluorescently labelled antibodies to detect surface receptors. Measuring basal levels of receptors provides information about the function of the platelet[@Hu2017]. Some receptors increase their expression in response to platelet agonists (such as the integrin α~IIb~β~3~ and the adhesion receptor P-selectin) such as protease-activating receptor activating peptide 1 (PAR1-AP), adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and collagen-related peptide (CRP). Another technique which can provide useful information about platelets is measuring calcium mobilisation by using a fluorescent calcium indicator. Activation of various receptors causes downstream activation of phospholipase C (PLC). In turn, this causes intracellular calcium release[@Varga-Szabo2009]. Another marker of platelet activation and coagulation is phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure. Under basal conditions, PS is mainly present in the inner leaflet of the phospholipid bilayer. Upon activation (e.g. by dual stimulation using collagen and thrombin), the PS is becomes exposed on the outer surface of the membrane, thereby activating factors in the coagulation pathway[@Bevers1983]. Changes in PS exposure can be measured using a fluorescently labelled antibody.

(ref:caption-platelet-diagram-background) **Cartoon of integrin α~IIb~β~3~ activation, P-selectin expression and platelet-leukocyte interactions.** Upon platelet activation by a strong agonist such as CRP, the integrin α~IIb~β~3~ exposes its binding site for fibrinogen and cross-links platelets. P-selectin is expressed in the membrane of alpha granules within platelets. Upon platelet activation, platelets secrete these granules and P-selectin is then expressed on the outer membrane. P-selectin on platelets can bind to P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) on leukocytes. Figure made using BioRender.com.

include_graphics(path = "figure/Bariatric_study/Platelet_activiation_integrin_p-selectin.png", dpi = NA)
```

As well as platelets aggregating to one another, platelets are also able to bind to leukocytes such as neutrophils. When activated, platelets express P-selectin. Neutrophils express P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1)[@Zarbock2007] (Figure \@ref(fig:platelet-activation-background)), therefore these cells can form aggregates through these adhesion receptors. The extent of these interactions can also be used to measure platelet activation. This can be done under basal conditions or after stimulation with an agonist such as CRP. Firstly, neutrophils are gated based on their forward scatter (FSC) and using an antibody for the leukocyte common antigen (CD45). An antibody for the platelet receptor CD41 (integrin α~IIb~) is then used to detect the proportion of neutrophils bound to platelets. 

Techniques such as Western Blotting can be used to quantify the levels of total protein or phosphoprotein. This can therefore be used to explore changes in signalling in platelets under basal conditions, or after stimulation with agonists or antagonists. PGE1 acts at a G~s~-coupled prostaglandin G protein coupled receptor (GPCR), which activates adenylyl cyclase and leads to subsequent production of cAMP. Protein kinase A (PKA) subsequently phosphorylates the vasodilator-stimulator phosphoprotein (VASP) at sites including Ser^157^ and Ser^239^[@Hezard2005]. The P2Y~12~ receptor acts at a G~i/o~ coupled receptor, therefore activating this receptor with ADP opposes the effects of PGE1. Measuring phosphorylation of VASP at these sites is used as an indicator of how well P2Y~12~ antagonists are inhibiting platelets. The lack of inhibition of VASP phosphorylation by ADP indicates more inhibition by drugs such as clopidogrel and ticagrelor[@Hezard2005].

Western blotting requires a lot of material and is limited by the number of proteins/phosphoproteins that can be detected at once. A solution to this issue is using Mass Spectrometry (MS). Using this method, platelets that have been isolated from blood are washed in a buffer and are lysed before MS analysis. This method enables detection of thousands of platelet proteins[@Huang2021], therefore providing extensive detail of the platelet environment. 

## Platelet traits as proxies for platelet function
Although there are not many large studies directly exploring platelet function, other measures of platelet characteristics are widely used in the clinic and among cohort studies. These charactertics are often reported as part of a routine full blood count. These include platelet count (PLT, absolute number of platelets), plateletcrit (PCT, the volume occupied by platelets), mean platelet volume (MPV, a measurement of the average size of platelets) and platelet distribution width (PDW, a measure of how similar platelets are in size). These are often used as diagnostic tools, for example a low platelet count is demonstrative of thrombocytopenia and a high platelet count is known as thrombocytosis/thrombocythaemia. Platelet traits have also been implicated in cardiovascular disease: there is MR evidence that higher PLT contributes to the risk of ischaemic stroke[@Gill2018], thereby suggesting that these platelet parameters have functional and clinical relevance. There is also evidence that alterations in these parameters associate with platelet function. For example, higher platelet count has been shown to associate with increased platelet aggregation[@Wurtz2012]. Previous studies have explored the association between BMI and platelet parameters. Some studies have found evidence for an association between BMI and both platelet count and mean platelet volume, however other studies have lacked evidence for an effect[@Furuncuoglu2016; @Han2018a; @Coban2005; @Heffron2018], suggesting that these effects are null. These observational studies may be subject to confounding, bias and reverse causation, therefore it is unclear whether there is a causal effect of BMI on these platelet traits, or whether effects are due to other factors. 

More recent haematology analysers such as the Sysmex XN series analysers can provide additional information about platelet structure. They use a combination of fluorescence and impedence flow cyotemtry. Additional readouts provided by these analyzers include immature platelet count (IPC, the number of immature platelets) as well as immature platelet fraction (IPF, the fraction of platelets which are immature), based on a gating of their forward scatter (FSC, size) and side fluorescence (SFL, an indicator of mRNA content). Detection of PLT and IPF by flow cytometry is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:sysmex-ipf)[@Corpataux2020]. Immature platelets, or reticulated platelets, are the youngest platelets in circulation. They persist for between 24 and 36 hours[@Corpataux2020]. Immature platelets are larger in size and have more mRNA than older circulating platelets. Over time the mRNA degrades and they gradually decrease in size. There are various studies which have suggested that a larger number of immature platelets may increase the risk of suffering from major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE)[@Ibrahim2014]. This suggests that immature platelets may be more reactive.

(ref:caption-sysmex-ipf) **Scatter plot indicating how platelets and immature platelets are detected using a Sysmex haematology analyser**. The forward scatter (FSC, a measure of cell size) and side fluorescence (SFL, a measure of cell mRNA content) are used to detect cell types. Immature platelets have a larger FSC and SFL. PLT-F = fluorescent platelet count, IPF = immature platelet fraction, RBC = red blood cells, WBC = white blood cells. Figure from Corpataux et al.[@Corpataux2020].

## Platelet primers
Platelets express receptors for various circulating molecules. Previous studies have reported that a range of soluble ligands, growth factors and cytokines which can enhance platelet function are elevated in obesity. These ‘platelet primers’ include insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)[@Frystyk1995] and thrombopoietin (TPO)[@Maury2010a; @Blair2015]. There is evidence other chemokines may be able to activate platelets. The C-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) receptor is activated by the chemokines macrophage derived chemokine (MDC/CCL22) and thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC/CCL17)[@Kowalska2000; @Abi-Younes2001]. There is observational evidence that higher BMI increases the circulating levels of MDC[@Kitahara2014]. These chemokines are important for chemotaxis of leukocytes. It has also been observed that these chemokines can activate platelets through platelet aggregation and calcium mobilisation experiments[@Abi-Younes2001]. It is unclear how these chemokines are able to exert effects. Known platelet primers (e.g. TPO) potentiate platelet activation through activation of the lipid kinase phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway[@Blair2015; @Pasquet2000]. This activation leads to recruitment of PH-domain proteins including protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) to the plasma membrane. PKB is subsequently phosphorylated on Threonine^308^ and Serine^473^ residues leading to its activation[@Hemmings2015]. Another pathway that has been implicated in platelet priming effects is the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. TPO can enhance thromboxane A~2~ (TxA~2~) synthesis through increasing the activation of extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK2)[@Ezumi1998; @VanWilligen2000]. It is possible that these pathways are also important in signalling via CCR4.

## Mechanisms of obesity-related disease
It is not fully understood how a high BMI might lead to changes in platelet function. Inflammatory mediators could be one such mechanism due to likely interactions between and inflammatory mediators in the blood. Obesity commonly presents with a state of low-grade chronic inflammation. There are two types of fat: white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT). WAT secretes proteins and peptides which have pro-inflammatory effects[@Cercato2019; @Kern2001]. There is evidence that obesity is associated with increases in interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)[@Esser2014]. Previous studies have identified a causal link between higher BMI and higher circulating levels of the inflammatory molecule C-reactive protein (CRP)[@Timpson2011]. More recent studies have used MR and have found an effect of BMI on a range of cytokines[@Kalaoja2021]. As platelets can be activated by inflammatory mediators and there is evidence for a causal relationship between BMI and CRP/cytokines, it is likely that inflammation could mediate this effect.

## The role of circulating platelet primers and disease
Recent studies have used large cohorts of people to identify SNPs which are associated with changes in levels of certain proteins. These are known as protein Quantitative Trait Loci (pQTL)[@Sun2018]. Sun et al. identified 1,927 genetic associations with 1,478 proteins. As a result of these pQTLs, there have been numerous studies that have been able to estimate causal effects of proteins in disease by using two sample MR. For a two sample MR, the exposure are measured in a separate cohort from the cohort of the outcome. An example of this is linking the interleukin-6 receptor (IL6R) to diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and coronary artery disease[@Bretherick2020]. The chemokines MDC and TARC both have SNPs which are associated with their levels[@Sun2018]. MDC and TARC have been implicated in platelet hyperactivity, however it is important to explore whether raised levels of MDC and TARC would have clinical implications such as a role in ischaemic heart disease. As a polymorphism in the CCR4 receptor has been implicated in myocardial infarction[@Noori2018], it is important to see how raised levels of MDC and TARC would relate to cardiovascular disease outcomes. 

## Evaluating the circulating proteome may reveal mechanistic insight into obesity-related diseases
Through literature searches, there is evidence for an association between BMI and chemokines such as MDC and TARC[@Kitahara2014]. Based on these observations, there may be many more circulating proteins which may also be raised in obesity and have downstream effects on platelet function. Many studies so far have had hypothesis driven approaches when looking at the effect of BMI on circulating protein levels[@Timpson2011]. This is due to the often limited range of protein detection assays, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Recent technologies have now been developed which allow protein detection in unprecedented scope and detail, for example the SOMAscan by SomaLogic[@Gold2012], which can detect around 4000 unique proteins. Studies that have attempted to characterise the plasmsa proteome of higher BMI have often only been in an observational framework[@Cominetti2018]. As the majority of druggable targets are proteins, it is valuable to explore the effects of BMI on circulating plasma proteins. It is estimated that 25% of proteins in the human proteome circulate in the blood[@Imming2006], including enzymes, protein kinases and transport proteins. Therefore, focusing on effects of adiposity on the circulating proteome may allow for the development of or repurposing of therapeutic interventions to reduce obesity-related disease. To explore the link between BMI, circulating proteins and platelet function, the blood is the tissue of interest. Many studies have blood/plasma/serum samples analysed from participants, therefore enabling exploration of a range of blood measures. This is in contrast to other studies, where other tissues are being sampled that are not as easy to get hold of due to issues with invasiveness and ethics. 

## Importance of interdisciplinary methods
Each experimental approach used when trying to answer hypotheses has biases and limitations. For example, using basic science it is possible to determine effects _in vitro_ or _ex vivo_, however it is difficult to fully understand how findings might translate in a clinical setting. Similarly, observational studies can provide useful clinical information, but these can generally only be used to identify correlation, not causation. Randomised control trials (RCTs) are considered the gold standard way to determine efficacy and causality, especially in drug trials, however these trials are often time consuming and expensive[@Bennett2017]. To overcome this issue, MR utilises genetic information to be able to provide causal estimates. MR is widely utilised since the cost of sequencing genomes has become more affordable. Therefore, a combination of laboratory experiments, observational clinical studies, RCTs and MR can therefore help to provide separate sources of evidence in investigating mechanisms of disease.

## Thesis aims 
The aims of the thesis are indicated below, with a schematic of the multi-step pathway which this thesis aims to explore (Figure \@ref(fig:Thesis-schematic)). The 3 overall aims are:

1) Explore the effect of BMI on platelet traits, platelet function and signalling.
2) Characterise the effects of the chemokines macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC) and thymus and activation regulated chemokine (TARC) on platelet function.
3) Determine the effects of adiposity on the plasma proteome and the potential contribution to platelet function.

## Thesis hypotheses
1) Higher BMI leads to changes in platelet signalling and platelet characteristics, therefore causing platelet hyperactivity
2) Proteins such as the chemokines MDC and TARC which circulate in the blood contribute to platelet hyperactivity.
3) Higher BMI alters the plasma proteome which may have downstream effects on platelet function.
