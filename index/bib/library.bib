abstract = {Vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) 239 phosphorylation flow cytometric assessment has been reported as a tool to evaluate the responsiveness to clopidogrel in coronary heart disease (CHD) patients. We report for the first time the comparison between flow cytometry and two challenger assays, aggregometry and Western blot. We studied 21 clopidogrel-treated CHD patients, and 28 healthy volunteers. Aggregometry showed platelet function inhibition in patients. VASP 239 phosphorylation was assessed using flow cytometry and Western blot. ADP receptor response index (RI) were calculated using the formula (PGEl) - (PGE1 + ADP)/(PGE1) x 100. Flow cytometry was not able to detect clopidogrel intake, as RI were 99 ± 10{\%} [68-130] in healthy volunteers, and 91 ± 17{\%} [66-127] in treated patients (ns). On the contrary, RI mean in Western blot was 91 ± 8{\%} [76-127] in healthy volunteers, and 37 ± 25{\%} [4-80] in patients (p{\textless}0.05). The extreme values in Western blot revealed inter-individual variability in response to treatment. The comparison between both tests showed a total lack of agreement. Flow cytometric VASP 239 phosphorylation assay lacks sensitivity to detect clopidogrel intake, contrary to Western blot and aggregometry. Caution is required before classifying patients as 'low-responders' to thienopyridines using such method. {\textcopyright} 2005 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

abstract = {Purpose In this study, we observe the distribution of gelsolin in human platelet and plasma and its association with different types of coronary heart disease (CHD). Methods One hundred and fourteen cases were included, with 33 stable angina pectoris (SAP) cases, 81 acute coronary syndrome (ACS) cases composed of 39 unstable angina pectoris (UAP) and 42 acute myocardial infarction (AMI) cases, and 31 healthy control participants. Gelsolin concentration in platelet rich plasma (PRP), platelet poor plasma (PPP), F-actin and Gc-globulin of PPP were determined by enzyme-linked immuno adsorbent assay (ELISA), and fluorescence intensity of CD62p and cytoplasmic calcium (Ca2+ i) in human platelets were measured with flow cytometry. Results Compared with the control group, the gelsolin level in PRP of UAP and AMI groups increased significantly (p{\textless}0.01), while gelsolin level in PPP of all the three patients group decreased markedly (p{\textless}0.01), and the CD62p, (Ca2+) ii of platelet, F-actin and Gc-globulin of the UAP and AMI groups increased significantly (p{\textless}0.01). Compared with the SAP group, the gelsolin level in PRP, the [Ca2+]i of platelet and CD62p expression of other two groups increased significantly (p{\textless}0.01), F-actin of AMI group increased markedly (p{\textless}0.01), and the Gc-globulin of other two groups have no statistic deference (p{\textgreater}0.05). Conclusions Platelet cytoskeleton protein dynamics vary among the different types of CHD. Gelsolin levels in PRP are markedly increased and accompanied by increasing platelet activity, platelet F-actin and (Ca2+)i are closely related to ACS while gelsolin levels in PPP are markedly lower. Abnormally increased platelet gelsolin levels show high positive correlation with the level of platelet activity. Platelet gelsolin might be a new potential therapeutic target of antiplatelet therapy of ACS.},

abstract = {Coagulation activation markers are being investigated as risk factors for cardiovascular disease; we examined the contribution of several lifestyle factors to variation in plasma levels of several activation markers measured in a population-based study of 1947 men. Smoking, alcohol, body mass index (BMI), leisure and work activity, social class, and use of prescribed medicines were each examined in turn. Specific assays of fibrin D-dimer and von Willebrand factor (vWF) activity showed similar relationships to lifestyle variables as we observed previously for less specific assays of D-dimer and vWF antigen. D-dimer levels increased with age, in smokers and in men taking prescribed medication, and were negatively associated with leisure time activity. vWF activity increased with age and showed a U-shaped distribution with BMI. Factors VIIc and VIIIc and thrombin-antithrombin complexes were associated with BMI, factor VIIIc and prothrombin fragments 1 + 2 (F1 + 2) were associated with age, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and F1 + 2 were associated with smoking, and aPTT showed a small negative association with alcohol consumption. We conclude that lifestyle modification has the possibility of favourably influencing several of these risk markers. In particular, cigarette smoking has a possibly reversible effect on coagulation activation (measured by F1 + 2 and D-dimer).},

We report the CCL22-induced accumulation of phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P(3)) in the leukemic T cell line CEM. CCL22 also had the ability to chemoattract human Th2 cells and CEM cells in a pertussis toxin-sensitive manner. Although the PI(3,4,5)P(3) accumulation along with the pertussis toxin-susceptible phosphorylation of protein kinase B were sensitive to the two phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitors, LY294002 and wortmannin, cell migration was unaffected. However, cell migration was abrogated with the Rho-dependent kinase inhibitor, Y-27632. These data demonstrate that although there is PI(3,4,5)P(3) accumulation downstream of CCR4, phosphoinositide 3-kinase activity is a dispensable signal for CCR4-stimulated chemotaxis of Th2 cells and the CEM T cell line.},

We performed GWAS of 63 flow-cytometry phenotypes, including measures of cell granularity, nucleic acid content, and reactivity, in 39,656 participants in the INTERVAL study, identifying 2,172 variant-trait associations. These include associations mediated by functional cellular structures such as secretory granules, implicated in vascular, thrombotic, inflammatory and neoplastic diseases. By integrating our results with epigenetic data and with signals from molecular abundance/disease GWAS, we infer the hematopoietic origins of population phenotypic variation and identify the transcription factor FOG2 as a regulator of platelet $\alpha$-granularity. We show how flow cytometry genetics can suggest cell types mediating complex disease risk and suggest efficacious drug targets, presenting Daclizumab/Vedolizumab in autoimmune disease as positive controls.

This Mendelian randomization study uses genetic variants as instruments to investigate whether there is a causal effect of genetically determined platelet count on CAD and ischemic stroke risk. Approach and Results- A genome-wide association study of 166 066 subjects was used to identify instruments and genetic association estimates for platelet count. Genetic association estimates for CAD and ischemic stroke were obtained from genome-wide association studies, including 60 801 CAD cases and 123 504 controls, and 60 341 ischemic stroke cases and 454 450 controls, respectively. The inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis of ratio method Mendelian randomization estimates was the main method used to obtain estimates for the causal effect of genetically determined platelet count on risk of cardiovascular outcomes. We found no significant Mendelian randomization effect of genetically determined platelet count on risk of CAD (odds ratio of CAD per SD unit increase in genetically determined platelet count, 1.01; 95{\%} CI, 0.98-1.04; P=0.60).

abstract = {Within minutes of acute myocardial infarction (MI), proinflammatory cytokines increase in the brain, heart, and plasma. We hypothesized that cardiac afferent nerves stimulated by myocardial injury signal the brain to increase central cytokines. Urethane-anesthetized male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) or sham LAD ligation after bilateral cervical vagotomy, sham vagotomy, or application of a 10{\%} phenol solution to the epicardial surface of the myocardium at risk. MI caused a significant increase in tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-1beta in the plasma and heart, which was blunted by vagotomy. MI also caused a significant increase in hypothalamic TNF-alpha and IL-1beta, which was not affected by vagotomy. In contrast, epicardial phenol blocked MI-induced increases in hypothalamic TNF-alpha and IL-1beta without affecting increases in the plasma and heart. These findings demonstrate that the appearance of proinflammatory cytokines in the brain after MI is independent of blood-borne cytokines and suggest that cardiac sympathetic afferent nerves activated by myocardial ischemia signal the brain to increase cytokine production. In addition, an intact vagus nerve is required for the full expression of proinflammatory cytokines in the injured myocardium and in the circulation. We conclude that the sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation of the heart both contribute to the acute proinflammatory response to MI.},

S1P is produced in cells by two sphingosine kinase isoenzymes, SphK1 and SphK2. Many cells secrete S1P, which can then act in an autocrine or paracrine manner. Most of the known actions of S1P are mediated by a family of five specific G protein-coupled receptors. More recently, it was shown that S1P also has important intracellular targets involved in inflammation, cancer and Alzheimer's disease. This suggests that S1P actions are much more complex than previously thought, with important ramifications for development of therapeutics. This review highlights recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms of action of S1P and its roles in disease.},

Main body: The pathogenesis of obesity includes the balance between calories consumed and energy expenditure followed by the maintenance of body weight. Diet, physical activity, environmental, behavioral and physiological factors are part of the complex process of weight loss, since there are several hormones and peptides involved in regulation of appetite, eating behavior and energy expenditure. The cardiovascular complications associated to obesity are also driven by processes involving hormones and peptides and which include inflammation, insulin resistance, endothelial dysfunction, coronary calcification, activation of coagulation, renin angiotensin or the sympathetic nervous systems. Pharmacological treatments are often needed to insure weight loss and weight maintenance as adjuncts to diet and physical activity in people with obesity and overweight patients. Conclusion: To accomplish satisfactory goals, patients and physicians seek for weight loss, weight maintenance and improvement of the risk factors associated to this condition, especially cardiovascular risk.},

In the present study, we have characterized and compared the plasma proteomes of two large independent cohorts of obese and overweight individuals using shotgun mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics.

Additionally, we replicated several known and new associations between proteins, clinical and molecular variables, such as insulin and glucose concentrations.

abstract = {The accurate measurement, prediction and treatment of high blood pressure (BP) are essential issues in the management of hypertension. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) has been shown to be superior to clinic BP measurements as ABPM can provide the following important information: (i) the mean BP levels, (ii) the diurnal variation in BP and (iii) the short-term BP variability. Among these parameters, there is increasing evidence that the mean nocturnal BP level is the most sensitive predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, several studies have shown that less nocturnal BP dipping, defined as less nocturnal BP decline relative to daytime BP, or a high night-day BP ratio was associated with poor prognosis irrespective of the 24-hour BP levels. These findings can be interpreted in at least two ways: namely, high nocturnal BP or less nocturnal BP dipping might be not only a potent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), but also a marker of pre-existing or concurrent diseases that can lead to nocturnal BP elevation. In this review, we consider the clinical utility of ABPM and in particular focus on the nocturnal BP levels or nocturnal BP dipping as a potent risk factor for CVD. In addition, the clinical management of high nocturnal BP and blunted nocturnal BP dipping with antihypertensive medications is discussed.},

For both daytime and nighttime systolic blood pressure (SBP), AAs and males had higher levels (P{\textless}0.001) than European Americans and females. Males also showed a greater increase with age (P{\textless}0.001) than females. For nighttime SBP, a faster increase of SBP with age (P{\textless}0.01) in AAs was additionally observed. The ethnic difference in nighttime SBP levels and its increase with age were significantly larger than in daytime SBP. For daytime and nighttime diastolic blood pressure, AAs had higher levels than European Americans (P{\textless}0.001), and this difference was significantly larger at night. From late adolescence onward, males showed a greater increase in diastolic blood pressure with age than females. Ethnic and gender differences persisted after adjustment for height, body mass index, socioeconomic status, and stress-related coping styles. Family history of essential hypertension explained ethnic differences in daytime SBP.|We observed significant ethnic and gender differences in longitudinal trajectories of ambulatory blood pressure in youth and young adults. The blunted nocturnal decline and its exacerbation with age in AAs corroborate and extend findings of cross-sectional studies.},

abstract = {In Mendelian randomization (MR) studies, where genetic variants are used as proxy measures for an exposure trait of interest, obtaining adequate statistical power is frequently a concern due to the small amount of variation in a phenotypic trait that is typically explained by genetic variants. A range of power estimates based on simulations and specific parameters for two-stage least squares (2SLS) MR analyses based on continuous variables has previously been published. However there are presently no specific equations or software tools one can implement for calculating power of a given MR study. Using asymptotic theory, we show that in the case of continuous variables and a single instrument, for example a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) or multiple SNP predictor, statistical power for a fixed sample size is a function of two parameters: the proportion of variation in the exposure variable explained by the genetic predictor and the true causal association etween the exposure and outcome variable. We demonstrate that power for 2SLS MR can be derived using the non-centrality parameter (NCP) of the statistical test that is employed to test whether the 2SLS regression coefficient is zero. We show that the previously published power estimates from simulations can be represented theoretically using this NCP-based approach, with similar estimates observed when the simulation-based estimates are compared with our NCP-based approach. General equations for calculating statistical power for 2SLS MR using the NCP are provided in this note, and we implement the calculations in a web-based application. {\textcopyright} The Author 2013; all rights reserved.},

abstract = {As insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is present in the alpha granules of platelets and its receptor is expressed on the platelet surface, it may contribute to the amplification of platelet responses and pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. The functional and signaling pathways that are involved in IGF-1 modulation of platelet function, however, are presently unknown. Here, I report that IGF-1 stimulation of platelets results in dose-dependent phosphorylation of the IGF receptor in the range of 1 to 100 nM. Phosphorylation of the IGF receptor is rapid and sustained, with maximal phosphorylation reached within 1 minute. Furthermore, IGF-1 stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and IRS-2 and their association with the p85 subunit of phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K). IGF-1-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2 and subsequent p85 binding is transient and precedes phosphorylation of protein kinase B (PKB) on Ser473. PAR-1-mediated platelet aggregation is potentiated by IGF-1 and this potentiation, together with PKB phosphorylation, is abolished by the PI3Kalpha inhibitors PI-103 and PIK-75. Importantly, the IGF receptor inhibitor NVP-AEW541 and the neutralization antibody alphaIR3 inhibit SFLLRN-stimulated aggregation, implicating IGF-1 in autocrine regulation of platelet function. These results demonstrate that IGF-1 activates the IGF receptor/IRS/PI3K/PKB pathway, and that PI3Kalpha is essential for the potentiatory effect of IGF-1 on platelet responses.},

We used central gene transfer of human interleukin (IL)-10, a potent antiinflammatory cytokine, to counter the effects of brain proinflammatory cytokines and examine their functional significance. Sprague-Dawley rats underwent coronary ligation to induce MI or sham surgery (SHAM). One week later, adenoviral vectors encoding human IL-10 (AdIL-10) or beta-galactosidase (betaGal) were injected (30 microL over 30 minutes) into lateral ventricle. One week after injection, there was abundant expression of human IL-10 in the brain of MI+AdIL-10 and SHAM+AdIL-10 rats. Compared with SHAM+betaGal, MI+betaGal had increased (P{\textless}0.05) IL-1beta and cyclooxygenase-2 mRNA and protein and nuclear factor kappaB activity in the hypothalamus, cyclooxygenase-2 fluorescence in perivascular cells of the paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus, prostaglandin E(2) in cerebrospinal fluid, and Fra-like activity (indicating neuronal excitation) in paraventricular nucleus. Plasma norepinephrine levels, lung/body weight, right ventricle/body weight, and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure were increased and maximal left ventricular dP/dt was decreased. All of these findings were ameliorated in MI rats treated with AdIL-10. Hypothalamic tumor necrosis factor-alpha and circulating tumor necrosis factor-alpha and IL-1beta levels, also increased in MI+betaGal, were not affected by AdIL-10 treatment. Rat native IL-10 was not affected by MI or AdIL-10. AdIL-10 had no effects on SHAM rats. The results demonstrate that cardiovascular and autonomic mechanisms leading to heart failure after MI can be modulated by manipulating the balance between proinflammatory and antiinflammatory cytokines in the brain.},

abstract = {In chronic heart failure (CHF), activation of the immune system occurs, which results in the production and release of proinflammatory cytokines, activation of the complement system, and production of autoantibodies. Thus, it is important to consider CHF as a systemic illness, not just a disease of the "pump." Immune activation in CHF can be divided into 2 broad categories: (1) immune activation by direct antigenic stimulation, or (2) immune activation secondary to cardiac injury that exposes "new antigens" capable of triggering an immune response against the heart. Cytokines are essential for the propagation and magnification of the immune response. They are involved in recruiting cells to the area of inflammation, stimulating cell division, proliferation, and differentiation. Circulating levels of the cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) are increased in patients with CHF. Thus, cytokines are key elements of immune activation. Studies to investigate the role of increased TNF-alpha levels have failed to show a correlation with worsening CHF, most likely because the immune system is redundant, and other proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL]-1 and IL-6) are known to be elevated in CHF. Approaches showing promise are those that enhance the natural anti-inflammatory response (eg, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), immunoadsorption, immune-modulation therapy [IMT]), rather than those that specifically target a single type of cytokine. The mechanism by which IVIG modulates the immune system is unknown. Immunoadsorption involves the removal of specific antibodies from circulation. IMT works by inducing apoptosis in a sample of blood, which is then administered back to the patient. The immune system reacts by removing the apoptotic cells, thus inducing a systemic anti-inflammatory response.},

abstract = {Patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) have an insufficient perfusion to the peripheral tissues due to decreased cardiac output. The compensatory mechanisms are triggered even prior to the occurrence of clinical symptoms, which include activation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and other neurohumoral factors. However, the long‑term activation of the SNS contributes to progressive cardiac dysfunction and has toxic effects on the cardiomyocytes. The mechanisms leading to the activation of SNS include changes in peripheral baroreceptor and chemoreceptor reflexes and the abnormal regulation of sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) in the central nervous system (CNS). Recent studies have focused on the role of brain mechanisms in the regulation of SNA and the progression of CHF. The renin‑angiotensin system, nitric oxide and pro‑inflammatory cytokines were shown to be involved in the abnormal regulation of SNA in the CNS. The alteration of these neurohumoral factors during CHF influences the activity of neurons in the autonomic regions and finally increase the sympathetic outflow. The present review summarizes the brain mechanisms contributing to sympathoexcitation in CHF.},

In the present paper, we show that, in human platelets, VASP is phosphorylated by PKC on Ser157, but not Ser239, in response to phorbol ester stimulation, in a manner blocked by the PKC inhibitor BIM I (bisindolylmaleimide I). In response to thrombin, VASP was also phosphorylated on Ser157, but this response was only partially inhibited by BIM I, indicating PKC-dependent and -independent pathways to VASP phosphorylation by thrombin. Using inhibitors, we have ruled out the possibility that the PKC-independent pathway acts through guanylate cyclase generation of cGMP, or through a phosphoinositide 3-kinase-dependent kinase. Inhibition of Rho kinase, however, substantially reduced Ser157 VASP phosphorylation, and its effects were additive with BIM I. This implicates Rho kinase and PKC as the major kinases that phosphorylate VASP Ser157 in response to thrombin in platelets.},

abstract = {Activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and augmented plasma and tissue levels of IL-6 are hallmarks of heart failure (HF). Within the forebrain, cardiovascular homeostasis is mediated in part by the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus. IL-6, via binding to the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R)/glycoprotein 130 (gp130) complex influences cellular and physiological responses. Thus, in the current study, we hypothesized that PVN IL-6R protein and gene expression are upregulated in HF vs. sham-operated rats, whereas gp130 levels in the same tissues remain stable. Six weeks after coronary ligation surgery, hemodynamic measurements were obtained, and HF rats were divided into moderate noncongestive and severe chronic congestive groups based on cardiac indices. Plasma IL-6 levels were determined and changes in gene and protein expression of IL-6R and gp130 between sham-operated and HF rats were determined via real-time PCR and Western blot analyses, respectively. Plasma levels of IL-6 were elevated in rats with severe, but not moderate, HF compared with sham-operated controls. In both moderate and severe HF rats, protein but not gene expression of IL-6R was significantly increased in PVN tissue but not in non-PVN tissue, compared with sham-operated controls. Gene and protein levels of the gp130 subunit were not altered by HF in either tissue analyzed. Collectively, these data suggest that within the brain of HF rats, IL-6R expression is not a global change. Rather the increased IL-6 levels characteristic of HF may alter PVN-mediated physiological responses via enhanced expression of the IL-6R.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Congestive heart failure (CHF) is an increasing public health problem. METHODS AND RESULTS: Among Framingham Heart Study subjects who were free of CHF at baseline, we determined the lifetime risk for developing overt CHF at selected index ages. We followed 3757 men and 4472 women from 1971 to 1996 for 124 262 person-years; 583 subjects developed CHF and 2002 died without prior CHF. At age 40 years, the lifetime risk for CHF was 21.0{\%} (95{\%} CI 18.7{\%} to 23.2{\%}) for men and 20.3{\%} (95{\%} CI 18.2{\%} to 22.5{\%}) for women. Remaining lifetime risk did not change with advancing index age because of rapidly increasing CHF incidence rates. At age 80 years, the lifetime risk was 20.2{\%} (95{\%} CI 16.1{\%} to 24.2{\%}) for men and 19.3{\%} (95{\%} CI 16.5{\%} to 22.2{\%}) for women. Lifetime risk for CHF doubled for subjects with blood pressure {\textgreater}/=160/100 versus {\textless}140/90 mm Hg. In a secondary analysis, we only considered those who developed CHF without an antecedent myocardial infarction; at age 40 years, the lifetime risk for CHF was 11.4{\%} (95{\%} CI 9.6{\%} to 13.2{\%}) for men and 15.4{\%} (95{\%} CI 13.5{\%} to 17.3{\%}) for women. CONCLUSIONS: When established clinical criteria are used to define overt CHF, the lifetime risk for CHF is 1 in 5 for both men and women. For CHF occurring in the absence of myocardial infarction, the lifetime risk is 1 in 9 for men and 1 in 6 for women, which highlights the risk of CHF that is largely attributable to hypertension. These results should assist in predicting the population burden of CHF and placing greater emphasis on prevention of CHF through hypertension control and prevention of myocardial infarction.},

Microglial activation results in their production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-$\alpha$. While release of these factors is typically intended to prevent further damage to CNS tissue, they may also be toxic to neurons and other glial cells. Mounting evidence indicates that chronic microglial activation may also contribute to the development and progression of neurodegenerative disorders. Unfortunately, determining the role of pro-inflammatory cytokines in these disorders has been complicated by their dual roles in neuroprotection and neurodegeneration. The purpose of this review is to summarize current understanding of the involvement of cytokines in neurodegenerative disorders and their potential signaling mechanisms in this context. Taken together, recent findings suggest that microglial activation and pro-inflammatory cytokines merit interest as targets in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.},

We analyzed these parameters in the follow up after the transfusion of plateletpheresis and evaluated them as quality markers in the assessment of plateletpheresis effectiveness.

Among these associations, protein-protein interactions are particularly important due to their versatility, specificity and adaptability. The STRING database aims to integrate all known and predicted associations between proteins, including both physical interactions as well as functional associations. To achieve this, STRING collects and scores evidence from a number of sources: (i) automated text mining of the scientific literature, (ii) databases of interaction experiments and annotated complexes/pathways, (iii) computational interaction predictions from co-expression and from conserved genomic context and (iv) systematic transfers of interaction evidence from one organism to another. STRING aims for wide coverage; the upcoming version 11.5 of the resource will contain more than 14 000 organisms. In this update paper, we describe changes to the text-mining system, a new scoring-mode for physical interactions, as well as extensive user interface features for customizing, extending and sharing protein networks. In addition, we describe how to query STRING with genome-wide, experimental data, including the automated detection of enriched functionalities and potential biases in the user's query data.

Using mass spectrometry-based plasma proteome profiling, we measured 1,294 plasma proteomes. Longitudinal monitoring of the cohort revealed individual-specific protein levels with wide-ranging effects of losing weight on the plasma proteome reflected in 93 significantly affected proteins. The adipocyte-secreted SERPINF1 and apolipoprotein APOF1 were most significantly regulated with fold changes of −16{\%} and +37{\%}, respectively (P  {\textless}  10 −13 ), and the entire apolipoprotein family showed characteristic differential regulation.

abstract = {It is well established that spontaneous and stimulated growth hormone (GH) secretion is diminished in human obesity. In contrast to classic GH deficiency, obesity is not associated with hypopituitary levels of circulating total (extractable) insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and reduced somatic growth. Thus, the riddle of "normal growth without GH" in obese children and the mechanisms behind the GH suppression have remained unsolved. Insulin reduces hepatic production of IGF-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1), an in vitro inhibitor of IGF bioactivity, and it has been suggested that the obesity-related hyperinsulinemia may increase free (bioactive) IGF in vivo by reducing the concentration of IGFBP-1. We have recently developed a method that during near in vivo conditions isolates the free, unbound fractions of IGF-I and IGF-II in human serum. Using this method, we have determined overnight fasting serum levels of free IGFs in obese subjects and compared the results with levels of total (extractable) IGFs, IGFBPs, GH, and insulin.

Whereas interactions and functional effects of TSPs on a variety of cell types have been studied extensively, the molecular and cellular basis for the differential effects of the SNPs remains under investigation. Here, we provide an integrative review on TSPs, their roles in CVD and cardiovascular cell physiology, and known properties and mechanisms of TSP SNPs relevant to CVD. In considering recent expansions to knowledge of the fundamental cellular roles and mechanisms of TSPs, as well as the effects of wild-type and variant TSPs on cells of the cardiovascular system, we aim to highlight knowledge gaps and areas for future research or of translational potential.},

abstract = {While chemokines have received considerable attention for their role in leukocyte chemotaxis, their effects on platelets have not been well described. We found that two CC chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) ligands, macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC) and thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC) induce concentration-dependent platelet aggregation and calcium flux. Flow cytometric analysis revealed the expression of CCR4 on platelets and a monoclonal antibody (mAb) to CCR4 inhibited MDC- and TARC-induced platelet aggregation, confirming that this effect is mediated through their common receptor CCR4. MDC fully desensitized TARC-induced calcium mobilization in platelets, while TARC was unable to completely desensitize a subsequent MDC response, which is similar to observations made in Th2 CD4(+) lymphocytes and CCR4-transfected cells. Aspirin (ASA) treatment of platelets allowed reversible primary aggregation but inhibited irreversible complete aggregation, suggesting that MDC- and TARC-induced full platelet aggregation is dependent on cyclooxygenase metabolites of arachidonic acid. MDC and TARC were unable to induce platelet aggregation and platelet secretion in washed human platelets, even though they induced a calcium flux, suggesting that plasma components are required for MDC- and TARC-induced platelet aggregation. Since Th2-type cytokines induce the release of MDC and TARC from cells and the expression of these chemokines is increased in Th2-type inflammation, we hypothesize that MDC and TARC may play a role in platelet activation seen in Th2 diseases, such as asthma and atopic dermatitis.},

abstract = {In healthy subjects and patients with hematological diseases, platelet populations can be distinguished with different response spectra in hemostatic and vascular processes. These populations partly overlap, and are less distinct than those of leukocytes. The platelet heterogeneity is linked to structural properties, and is enforced by inequalities in the environment. Contributing factors are variability between megakaryocytes, platelet ageing, and positive or negative priming of platelets during their time in circulation. Within a hemostatic plug or thrombus, platelet heterogeneity is enhanced by unequal exposure to agonists, with populations of contracted platelets in the thrombus core, discoid platelets at the thrombus surface, patches of ballooned and procoagulant platelets forming thrombin, and coated platelets binding fibrin. Several pathophysiological hematological conditions can positively or negatively prime the responsiveness of platelet populations. As a consequence, in vivo and in vitro markers of platelet activation can differ in thrombotic and hematological disorders.},

abstract = {Purpose: The nutritional intervention program “DiOGenes” focuses on how obesity can be prevented and treated from a dietary perspective. We generated differential plasma proteome profiles in the DiOGenes cohort to identify proteins associated with weight loss and maintenance and explore their relation to body mass index, fat mass, insulin resistance, and sensitivity. Experimental design: Relative protein quantification was obtained at baseline and after combined weight loss/maintenance phases using isobaric tagging and MS/MS. A Welch t-test determined proteins differentially present after intervention. Protein relationships with clinical variables were explored using univariate linear models, considering collection center, gender and age as confounding factors. Results: Four hundred and seventy three subjects were measured at baseline and end of the intervention; 39 proteins were longitudinally differential. Proteins with largest changes were sex hormone-binding globulin, adiponectin, C-reactive protein, calprotectin, serum amyloid A, and proteoglycan 4 (PRG4), whose association with obesity and weight loss is known. We identified new putative biomarkers for weight loss/maintenance. Correlation between PRG4 and proline-rich acidic protein 1 variation and Matsuda insulin sensitivity increment was showed. Conclusion and clinical relevance: MS-based proteomic analysis of a large cohort of non-diabetic overweight and obese individuals concomitantly identified known and novel proteins associated with weight loss and maintenance.},

This study evaluated association between percentage of reticulated platelets ({\%}RP) and the response to antiplatelet therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This prospective, pilot, case-control, clinical trial included 79 subjects stratified in three groups: group I included 30 patients with T2DM, group II included 34 non-diabetic patients and 15 healthy age and sex matched healthy volunteers were enrolled in control group. Platelet response to clopidogrel and aspirin was assessed by Multiplate({\textregistered}) aggregometry analyzer. Individual response to dual antiplatelet therapy was estimated by the percentage of decrease in overall platelet aggregability ({\%}DPA) obtained after antiplatelet therapy, calculated by presented formulas: {\%}DPAadp = 100 × (1 - ADP/TRAP) and {\%}DPAaspi = 100 × (1 - ASPI/TRAP). {\%}RP was significantly higher in diabetics, than in non-diabetics, (3.17 ± 1.26 vs. 2.39 ± 1.56; p {\textless} 0.05).

Exploiting the fact that genotypes are randomly assigned at meiosis, are independent of non-genetic confounding, and are unmodified by disease processes, mendelian randomisation can be used to test the hypothesis that the association of a plasma biomarker with disease is causal.|We performed two mendelian randomisation analyses. First, we used as an instrument a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the endothelial lipase gene (LIPG Asn396Ser) and tested this SNP in 20 studies (20,913 myocardial infarction cases, 95,407 controls). Second, we used as an instrument a genetic score consisting of 14 common SNPs that exclusively associate with HDL cholesterol and tested this score in up to 12,482 cases of myocardial infarction and 41,331 controls. As a positive control, we also tested a genetic score of 13 common SNPs exclusively associated with LDL cholesterol.|Carriers of the LIPG 396Ser allele (2{\textperiodcentered}6{\%} frequency) had higher HDL cholesterol (0{\textperiodcentered}14 mmol/L higher, p=8×10(-13)) but similar levels of other lipid and non-lipid risk factors for myocardial infarction compared with non-carriers. This difference in HDL cholesterol is expected to decrease risk of myocardial infarction by 13{\%} (odds ratio [OR] 0{\textperiodcentered}87, 95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}84-0{\textperiodcentered}91). However, we noted that the 396Ser allele was not associated with risk of myocardial infarction (OR 0{\textperiodcentered}99, 95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}88-1{\textperiodcentered}11, p=0{\textperiodcentered}85). From observational epidemiology, an increase of 1 SD in HDL cholesterol was associated with reduced risk of myocardial infarction (OR 0{\textperiodcentered}62, 95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}58-0{\textperiodcentered}66). However, a 1 SD increase in HDL cholesterol due to genetic score was not associated with risk of myocardial infarction (OR 0{\textperiodcentered}93, 95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}68-1{\textperiodcentered}26, p=0{\textperiodcentered}63). For LDL cholesterol, the estimate from observational epidemiology (a 1 SD increase in LDL cholesterol associated with OR 1{\textperiodcentered}54, 95{\%} CI 1{\textperiodcentered}45-1{\textperiodcentered}63) was concordant with that from genetic score (OR 2{\textperiodcentered}13, 95{\%} CI 1{\textperiodcentered}69-2{\textperiodcentered}69, p=2×10(-10)).|Some genetic mechanisms that raise plasma HDL cholesterol do not seem to lower risk of myocardial infarction.

Nocturnal BP fall was strongly and directly related to 24-h SD, the relationship with 24-h wSD being much weaker and inverse. The difference between SD and wSD was almost exclusively determined by the size of nocturnal BP fall. wSD of systolic BP was significantly related to LVMI, while 24-h SD was not.|Conventional 24-h SD of BP is markedly influenced by nocturnal BP fall.

abstract = {G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) initiate diverse down-stream signaling events in response to ligand stimulation, as rapid activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase ERK1 and ERK2. The chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) is the agonist for several chemokine receptors that belong to the GPCR superfamily, CCR2 being the most important. Stimulation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) by MCP-1 has been implicated in integrin activation and chemotaxis, but the molecular pathways down-stream of the receptors remain unclear. To dissect the cascade of events leading to MAPK activation upon CCR2 receptor stimulation, several specific inhibitors and mutants of signal transduction proteins were used in monocytic cells endogenously expressing CCR2 and/or in human embryonic kidney-293 cells transfected with CCR2B receptors and epitope-tagged ERK1. We show that ERK activation by MCP-1 involves heterotrimeric Gi protein subunits, protein kinase C, phosphoinositide-3-kinase, and Ras. On the other hand, the activity of cytosolic tyrosine kinases, epidermal growth factor receptor transactivation, or variations in intracellular calcium levels are not required for the mitogenic activation elicited by MCP-1. In addition, we find that internalization of CCR2B itself is not necessary for efficient MCP-1-induced activation of ERK, although a dynamin mutant partially inhibits ERK stimulation. These results suggest that different parallel pathways are being activated that lead to the full activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade and that internalization of other signaling proteins but not of the receptor is required for complete ERK activation.},

The aim of the present study was to analyze changes and determinants of LV geometry after 1 year of antihypertensive treatment in children with primary hypertension (PH) in relation to metabolic abnormalities and anthropometrical parameters. In 86 children (14.1 ± 2.4 years) with newly diagnosed PH, LV geometry and biochemical parameters before and after 12 months of standard antihypertensive therapy were assessed. At baseline, normal LV geometry (NG) was found in 42 (48.9{\%}), concentric remodeling (CR) in 4 (4.6{\%}), concentric hypertrophy (CH) in 8 (9.3{\%}), and eccentric hypertrophy (EH) in 32 (37.2{\%}) patients. The prevalence of NG in patients with severe hypertension was significantly lower than in patients with ambulatory hypertension. There were no differences in dipping status in relation to LV geometry. Patients with CH and EH were more viscerally obese than patients with NG. Patients with CH had higher diastolic blood pressure in comparison with EH patients (p {\textless} 0.05). The main predictor of relative wall thickness (RWT) was the triglycerides to high density lipoprotein cholesterol (TG/HDL) ratio (R(2 ) = 0.319, $\beta$ = 0.246, p = 0.004). Patients received 12 months of antihypertensive treatment, either lifestyle modification only (n = 37) or lifestyle modification plus antihypertensive medications (n = 49) if severe ambulatory hypertension or target organ damage were present. After 12 months of treatment the prevalence of EH (37.2{\%} vs 18.6{\%}, p = 0.003) decreased but prevalence of CH did not change. Patients in whom RWT decreased also decreased waist circumference and TG/HDL; the main predictor of RWT decrease was a decrease of the TG/HDL ratio ($\beta$ = 0.496, R (2) = 0.329, p = 0.002).

Decrease of abdominal obesity and insulin resistance are the most important predictors of normalization of LV geometry, however CH has lower potential to normalize LV geometry.},

The LAVI was categorized as normal (≤28 mL/m(2)) or increased (mild, 29-33 mL/m(2); moderate, 34-39 mL/m(2); severe, ≥40 mL/m(2)).|Progressive increases in LAVI and mortality were noted with abnormal LV geometry. Similarly, abnormal LV geometry and mortality were significantly higher in patients with increased LAVI. In patients who died vs surviving patients, the LAVI ± SD was significantly higher (33.0±14.8 vs 28.1±10.8 mL/m(2); P{\textless}.001) and abnormal LV geometry was significantly more prevalent (62{\%} vs 44{\%}; P{\textless}.001). Compared with those with a normal LAVI, patients with a severe LAVI had a 42{\%} increased risk of mortality. In patients with normal LV geometry or concentric remodeling, a severe LAVI was a significant independent predictor of mortality, with an increased risk of 28{\%} and 46{\%}, respectively. Similarly, in patients with eccentric hypertrophy and concentric hypertrophy, the mortality risk in patients with a severe LAVI was twice that of patients with a normal LAVI. Comparison of area under the curve (0.565 [without LAVI] vs 0.596 [with LAVI]; P{\textless}.001] and predictive models with and without LAVI for mortality prediction were significant, indicating increased mortality prediction by the addition of LAVI to other independent predictors.|The LAVI significantly predicts mortality risk, independent of LV geometry, and adds to the overall mortality prediction in a large cohort of patients with preserved systolic function.},

Minocycline (MC) is a known anti-inflammatory agent; thus, the effect of MC on IL-6 in the first 24 h of AIS was investigated to determine potential anti-inflammatory activity. The Minocycline to Improve Neurologic Outcome in Stroke (MINOS) study was a non-randomized dose-escalation (3.0-10.0 mg/kg) trial of IV MC for AIS within 6 h of onset. Plasma IL-6 samples were collected prior to MC treatment at 1, 24, and 72 h and compared to those collected in a separate observational study of blood biomarkers in AIS. IL-6 levels were measured by commercially available ELISA kits. The lower limit of detection for IL-6 was 1 pg/ml. Sixty MINOS subjects and 29 non-MINOS subjects were enrolled, and there was no difference in baseline stroke severity. There was no significant difference in IL-6 level pre-MC treatment at 1, 24, or 72 h. However, the odds of a non-detectable IL-6 at 24 h in MINOS were 8.94 (95{\%} CI 2.62-30.46) compared with non-MINOS subjects. It is likely that even low doses of MC have a potent systemic anti-inflammatory effect in AIS. Whether this results in improved outcome will be tested in a randomized clinical trial.},

abstract = {The prognostic importance of the nocturnal systolic blood pressure (SBP) fall, adjusted for average 24-hour SBP levels, is unclear. The Ambulatory Blood Pressure Collaboration in Patients With Hypertension (ABC-H) examined this issue in a meta-analysis of 17 312 hypertensives from 3 continents. Risks were computed for the systolic night-to-day ratio and for different dipping patterns (extreme, reduced, and reverse dippers) relative to normal dippers. ABC-H investigators provided multivariate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs), with and without adjustment for 24-hour SBP, for total cardiovascular events (CVEs), coronary events, strokes, cardiovascular mortality, and total mortality. Average 24-hour SBP varied from 131 to 140 mm Hg and systolic night-to-day ratio from 0.88 to 0.93. There were 1769 total CVEs, 916 coronary events, 698 strokes, 450 cardiovascular deaths, and 903 total deaths. After adjustment for 24-hour SBP, the systolic night-to-day ratio predicted all outcomes: from a 1-SD increase, summary HRs were 1.12 to 1.23. Reverse dipping also predicted all end points: HRs were 1.57 to 1.89. Reduced dippers, relative to normal dippers, had a significant 27{\%} higher risk for total CVEs. Risks for extreme dippers were significantly influenced by antihypertensive treatment (P{\textless}0.001): untreated patients had increased risk of total CVEs (HR, 1.92), whereas treated patients had borderline lower risk (HR, 0.72) than normal dippers. For CVEs, heterogeneity was low for systolic night-to-day ratio and reverse/reduced dipping and moderate for extreme dippers. Quality of included studies was moderate to high, and publication bias was undetectable. In conclusion, in this largest meta-analysis of hypertensive patients, the nocturnal BP fall provided substantial prognostic information, independent of 24-hour SBP levels.},

A total of 300 patients with IHD as having acute myocardial infarction (AMI; n=100), stable angina (SA; n=100) or unstable angina (UA; n=100) and 100 healthy subjects as a control group were enrolled to study. Serum samples from all participants were tested for the CXCL10, CCL20 and CCL22 levels by using ELISA. The SNPs were determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. The mean serum concentrations of CXCL10, CCL20 and CCL22 in AMI patients (395.97±21.20Pg/mL, 108.38±10.31Pg/mL and 1852.58±205.77Pg/mL), SA patients (405.48±27.36Pg/mL, 90.20±7.69Pg/mL and 2322.04±231.23Pg/mL) and UA patients (396.69±22.79Pg/mL, 141.87±18.10Pg/mL and 2754.89±211.70Pg/mL) were significantly higher than in the healthy group (179.38±8.85Pg/mL, 51.92±4.62Pg/mL and 451.82±23.76Pg/mL, respectively; P{\textless}0.001).

The serum levels of CCL20 and CCL22 in UA patients were significantly higher than those in SA and AMI patients, respectively (P{\textless}0.01 and P{\textless}0.003, respectively). The serum levels of CXCL10 and CCL20 in diabetic patients were significantly higher in comparison to non-diabetic patients (P{\textless}0.05 and P{\textless}0.02, respectively). The serum levels of CCL22 in dyslipidemic- and obese patients were also significantly higher in comparison with non-dyslipidemic- and non-obese patients, correspondingly (P{\textless}0.05 and P{\textless}0.01, respectively). There were no significant differences between men and women or between patients who treated with statin, aspirin, $\beta$-blockers or angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and patients without mentioned treatment regarding the levels of chemokines. The frequency of the GG genotype at SNP rs4508917 in CXCL10 gene was higher, whereas the frequency of the AA genotype at SNP rs4359426 in CCL22 gene was lower in total patients with IHD as compared with healthy subjects (P{\textless}0.04 and P{\textless}0.002, respectively). These results showed that the higher levels of CXCL10, CCL20 and CCL22 were associated with IHD. The serum levels of chemokines may influence by the certain traditional risk factors of IHD and some studied SNPs, but did not influence by treatment and gender of patients.},

abstract = {Background- Aspirin use in heart failure (HF) is controversial. The drug has proven benefit in comorbidities associated with HF; however, retrospective analysis of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor trials and prospective comparisons with warfarin have shown increased risk of morbidity with aspirin use. This study aims to evaluate the association of low-dose aspirin with mortality and morbidity risk in a large community-based cohort. Methods and Results- This was a retrospective cohort study of patients attending an HF disease management program. Aspirin use at baseline and its association with mortality and HF hospitalization in the population was examined. Of 1476 patients (mean age, 70.4±12.4 years; 63{\%} men), 892 (60.4{\%}) were prescribed aspirin. Low-dose aspirin (75 mg/d) was prescribed to 828 (92.8{\%}) patients. Median follow-up time was 2.6 (0.8-4.5) years. During the follow-up period, 464 (31.4{\%}) patients died. In adjusted analysis, low-dose aspirin use was associated with reduced mortality risk compared with nonaspirin use (hazard ratio=0.58; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.46-0.74), and this was confirmed by a propensity-matched subgroup analysis. Low-dose aspirin use was associated with reduced risk of HF hospitalization compared with nonaspirin use in the total population (adjusted hazard ratio=0.70; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.54-0.90). In adjusted analysis, there was no difference in mortality or HF hospitalization between high-dose aspirin users ({\textgreater}75 mg/d) and nonaspirin users. Conclusions- In this study, low-dose aspirin therapy was associated with a significant reduction in mortality and morbidity risk during long-term follow-up. These results suggest that low-dose aspirin may have a continuing role in secondary prevention in HF and underline the need for more trials of low-dose aspirin use in HF.},

The biological signaling regulated by S1P(3) receptor has not been fully elucidated because of the lack of an S1P(3) receptor-specific antagonist or agonist. We developed a novel S1P(3) receptor antagonist, 1-(4-chlorophenylhydrazono)-1-(4-chlorophenylamino)-3,3-dimethyl- 2-butanone (TY-52156), and show here that the S1P-induced decrease in coronary flow (CF) is mediated by the S1P(3) receptor. In functional studies, TY-52156 showed submicromolar potency and a high degree of selectivity for S1P(3) receptor. TY-52156, but not an S1P(1) receptor antagonist [(R)-phosphoric acid mono-[2-amino-2-(3-octyl-phenylcarbamoyl)-ethyl] ester; VPC23019] or S1P(2) receptor antagonist [1-[1,3-dimethyl-4-(2-methylethyl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridin-6-yl]-4-(3,5-dichloro-4-pyridinyl)-semicarbazide; JTE013], inhibited the decrease in CF induced by S1P in isolated perfused rat hearts. We further investigated the effect of TY-52156 on both the S1P-induced increase in intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) and Rho activation that are responsible for the contraction of human coronary artery smooth muscle cells. TY-52156 inhibited both the S1P-induced increase in [Ca(2+)](i) and Rho activation. In contrast, VPC23019 and JTE013 inhibited only the increase in [Ca(2+)](i) and Rho activation, respectively. We further confirmed that TY-52156 inhibited FTY-720-induced S1P(3) receptor-mediated bradycardia in vivo. These results clearly show that TY-52156 is both sensitive and useful as an S1P(3) receptor-specific antagonist and reveal that S1P induces vasoconstriction by directly activating S1P(3) receptor and through a subsequent increase in [Ca(2+)](i) and Rho activation in vascular smooth muscle cells.},

The authors sought to explore the potential utility of two newly derived BPV indices: weighted standard deviation (wBPSD) and real average variability (ARV), as well as two standard ambulatory blood pressure indices: average 24-hour systolic blood pressure (SBP) and 24-hour SBP load, to identify children at high risk for left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy (LVH). The study group consisted of 67 consecutive children who were referred to our institution for evaluation of suspected hypertension. LV mass was estimated by M-mode echocardiography using Devereux's formula according to the Penn convention and indexed for height(2.7) . We found a statistically significant, positive correlation between 24-hour wBPSD and LV mass index (LVMI) ($\rho$=0.389; P=.002) and no correlation between 24-hour ARV and LVMI (P{\textgreater}.05). However, partial correlation analysis of 24-hour wBPSD adjusted for body mass index (BMI) and LVMI showed only a weak correlation ($\rho$=0.3; P=.022). By using multiple linear regression analysis in a model with LVMI as a dependent variable and 24-hour wBPSD, 24-hour ARV, and BMI as independent variables, only BMI showed statistically significant independent positive associations with LVMI (P=.028). Results of our study showed that currently used BPV indices (24-hour wBPSD and 24-hour ARV) are not clinically reliable parameters to identify children at risk for LVH. Apparent contribution of the 24-hour wBPSD parameter to LVMI is negligible and is secondary to its close correlation with BMI ($\rho$=0.335 P=.009).},

abstract = {Junctional adhesion molecule-1 (JAM-1) forms part of the tight junction between adjacent endothelial cells. Using microarray technology, we showed previously that JAM-1 was differentially expressed in the brain stem of spontaneously hypertensive rats compared with normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. In this study, we quantified the expression of JAM-1 in the brain stem of spontaneously hypertensive rats and WKY rats and established whether any differential expression was confined to this region of the brain or was ubiquitous throughout the central nervous system and, indeed, the whole body. Because the nucleus tractus solitarii plays a pivotal role in arterial pressure regulation, we assessed whether JAM-1 in this region affects the chronic regulation of arterial pressure. Real time RT-PCR revealed that JAM-1 mRNA was upregulated in multiple regions of the brain and all of the peripheral vascular beds studied. In the nucleus tractus solitarii, the level of JAM-1 mRNA was significantly higher in both young (3-week-old, prehypertensive) and adult male spontaneously hypertensive rats (15 to 18 weeks old) than that of age-matched WKY rats (fold differences; prehypertensives: 1.01+/-0.06 versus 1.59+/-0.13; n=10; P{\textless}0.01; adult: 1.08+/-0.14 versus 2.86+/-0.57; n=10; P{\textless}0.01). After adenoviral-mediated expression of JAM-1 in the nucleus tractus solitarii of adult WKY rats (15 weeks old; n=6), systolic pressure was increased from 120+/-4 to 132+/-4 mm Hg (P{\textless}0.01). Our data suggest that JAM-1 expression in the spontaneously hypertensive rat is upregulated throughout the body compared with the WKY rat and that this is not secondary to the hypertension. When JAM-1 is expressed in the nucleus tractus solitarii, it raises arterial pressure, suggesting a novel prohypertensive role for this protein within the brain stem.},

abstract = {Type 2 diabetes mellitus increases atherothrombotic risk. Platelets in individuals with diabetes show increased activity at baseline and in response to agonists, ultimately leading to increased aggregation. Increased expression of platelet surface adhesion molecules and receptors, enhanced production of thromboxane and thrombin and disturbances in platelet calcium homeostasis are well documented. As intra-arterial thrombi are initiated by platelets, strategies to limit acute thrombotic events have largely focused on antiplatelet agents. Aspirin remains the cornerstone of antiplatelet therapy but appears to have limited benefit in diabetes. Use of thienopyridines and platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors has been shown to benefit high-risk patient populations. This review summarises the different platelet abnormalities characterised in diabetes and the role of currently used antiplatelet agents.},

abstract = {The role of platelets in hemostasis and thrombosis is dependent on a complex balance of activatory and inhibitory signaling pathways. Inhibitory signals released from the healthy vasculature suppress platelet activation in the absence of platelet receptor agonists. Activatory signals present at a site of injury initiate platelet activation and thrombus formation; subsequently, endogenous negative signaling regulators dampen activatory signals to control thrombus growth. Understanding the complex interplay between activatory and inhibitory signaling networks is an emerging challenge in the study of platelet biology, and necessitates a systematic approach to utilize experimental data effectively. In this review, we will explore the key points of platelet regulation and signaling that maintain platelets in a resting state, mediate activation to elicit thrombus formation, or provide negative feedback. Platelet signaling will be described in terms of key signaling molecules that are common to the pathways activated by platelet agonists and can be described as regulatory nodes for both positive and negative regulators.},

PGSs have shown promise for early risk prediction4{\{}$\backslash$textendash{\}}7, and there is potential to use PGSs to understand disease biology in parallel8. Here, we investigate the role plasma protein levels play in cardiometabolic disease risk in a cohort of 3,087 healthy individuals using PGSs. We found PGSs for coronary artery disease (CAD), type 2 diabetes (T2D), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and ischaemic stroke (IS) were associated with levels of 49 plasma proteins. These associations were polygenic in architecture, largely independent of cis protein QTLs, and robust to environmental variation. Over a median 7.7 years follow-up, 28 of these plasma proteins were associated with future myocardial infarction (MI) or T2D events, 16 of which were causal mediators between polygenic risk and incident disease. These protein mediators of polygenic disease risk included targets of approved therapies which may have repurposing potential. Our results demonstrate that PGSs can identify proteins with causal roles in disease, and may have utility in drug development.Competing Interest StatementDr. Sekar Kathiresan is the CEO of Verve Therapeutics.

Using a Mendelian randomisation approach, we studied 108,812 individuals from the general population. During a median of 4.7 years of follow-up (range 0-37), 8002 developed non-skin cancer, 3347 non-melanoma skin cancer, 1396 lung cancer, 637 other smoking related cancers, 1203 colon cancer, 159 kidney cancer, 1402 breast cancer, 1062 prostate cancer, and 2804 other cancers. Participants were genotyped for five genetic variants associated with BMI. Two Danish general population studies, the Copenhagen General Population and the Copenhagen City Heart Study. In observational analyses, overall risk of non-melanoma skin cancer was 35 {\%} (95 {\%} confidence interval 28-42 {\%}) lower and risk of lung cancer 32 {\%} (19-43 {\%}) lower in individuals with a BMI ≥ 30 versus 18.5-24.9 kg/m(2). Corresponding risk of breast cancer was 20 {\%} (0-44 {\%}) higher in postmenopausal women. BMI was not associated with risk of colon, kidney, other smoking related cancers, prostate cancer, or other cancers. In genetic analyses, carrying 7-10 versus 0-4 BMI increasing alleles was associated with a 3 {\%} higher BMI (P {\textless} 0.001), but not with risk of cancer. In instrumental variable analysis for a 10 kg/m(2) higher genetically determined BMI the odds ratio for any non-skin cancer was 1.16 (0.64-2.09), with a corresponding observational estimate of 0.94 (0.88-1.01). Using 108,812 individuals from the general population, we found that observationally high BMI was associated with lower risk of lung and skin cancer overall and with higher risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women, but not with other types of cancer. BMI increasing alleles were not associated with risk of cancer, and results do not support causal associations. Power to test associations for some cancer sites was low.},

abstract = {Autonomic nervous system dysfunction, exaggerated inflammation, and impaired vascular repair are all hallmarks of hypertension. Considering that bone marrow (BM) is a major source of the inflammatory cells (ICs) and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), we hypothesized that impaired BM-autonomic nervous system interaction contributes to dysfunctional BM activity in hypertension. In the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR), we observed a {\textgreater}30{\%} increase in BM and blood ICs (CD4.8(+)) and a {\textgreater}50{\%} decrease in EPCs (CD90(+).CD4.5.8(-)) when compared with the normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rat. Increased tyrosine hydroxylase (70{\%}) and norepinephrine (160{\%}) and decreased choline acetyl transferase (30{\%}) and acetylcholine esterase (55{\%}) indicated imbalanced autonomic nervous system in SHR BM. In Wistar-Kyoto rat, night time-associated elevation in sympathetic nerve activity (50{\%}) and BM norepinephrine (41{\%}) was associated with increased ICs (50{\%}) and decreased EPCs (350{\%}) although BM sympathetic denervation decreased ICs (25{\%}) and increased EPCs (40{\%}). In contrast, these effects were blunted in SHR, possibly because of chronic downregulation of BM adrenergic receptor $\alpha$2a (by 50{\%}-80{\%}) and $\beta$2 (30{\%}-45{\%}). Application of norepinephrine resulted in increased BM IC activation/release, which was prevented by preadministration of acetylcholine. Electrophysiological recordings of femoral sympathetic nerve activity showed a more robust femoral sympathetic nerve activity in SHR when compared with Wistar-Kyoto rat, peaking earlier in the respiratory cycle, indicative of increased sympathetic tone. Finally, manganese-enhanced MRI demonstrated that presympathetic neuronal activation in SHR was associated with an accelerated retrograde transport of the green fluorescent protein-labeled pseudorabies virus from the BM. These observations demonstrate that a dysfunctional BM autonomic nervous system is associated with imbalanced EPCs and ICs in hypertension.},

abstract = {Obesity is accompanied by complications such as hypertension, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and atherosclerosis, which in turn cause ischaemic heart disease, stroke and premature death. The underlying mechanisms behind imbalance in energy intake and energy expenditure that lead to obesity are still controversial. In most populations, obesity is more common among women than men and is a multifactorial phenotype, which may result from a complex network of genetic and nongenetic factors. The relative importance of genetic factors for obesity is under debate. Genome searches using polymorphic markers in inbred mice with phenotypes that result in extreme obesity and studies of human candidate genes are being performed in an attempt to identify genes that contribute to obesity. There is evidence that body weight is physiologically regulated and it has been postulated that the storage of fat may provide signals to the brain that the body is obese, which in turn may make the subject eat less and burn more fuel. One of the molecules that may be involved in such signalling is the obese (ob) gene product. Mutations in ob result in profound obesity and type II diabetes in mice. The mouse ob gene and its human homologue have been cloned and sequenced. The gene is expressed in adipose tissue and the product has features of a secreted protein. We have investigated human ob expression in subcutaneous and omental adipose tissue obtained from non-obese and massively obese subjects using in situ hybridization histochemistry and report on overexpression in obese people.},

abstract = {Introduction: COVID-19 may predispose to both venous and arterial thromboembolism due to excessive inflammation, hypoxia, immobilisation and diffuse intravascular coagulation. Reports on the incidence of thrombotic complications are however not available. Methods: We evaluated the incidence of the composite outcome of symptomatic acute pulmonary embolism (PE), deep-vein thrombosis, ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction or systemic arterial embolism in all COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU of 2 Dutch university hospitals and 1 Dutch teaching hospital. Results: We studied 184 ICU patients with proven COVID-19 pneumonia of whom 23 died (13{\%}), 22 were discharged alive (12{\%}) and 139 (76{\%}) were still on the ICU on April 5th 2020. All patients received at least standard doses thromboprophylaxis. The cumulative incidence of the composite outcome was 31{\%} (95{\%}CI 20-41), of which CTPA and/or ultrasonography confirmed VTE in 27{\%} (95{\%}CI 17-37{\%}) and arterial thrombotic events in 3.7{\%} (95{\%}CI 0-8.2{\%}). PE was the most frequent thrombotic complication (n = 25, 81{\%}). Age (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.05/per year, 95{\%}CI 1.004-1.01) and coagulopathy, defined as spontaneous prolongation of the prothrombin time {\textgreater} 3 s or activated partial thromboplastin time {\textgreater} 5 s (aHR 4.1, 95{\%}CI 1.9-9.1), were independent predictors of thrombotic complications. Conclusion: The 31{\%} incidence of thrombotic complications in ICU patients with COVID-19 infections is remarkably high. Our findings reinforce the recommendation to strictly apply pharmacological thrombosis prophylaxis in all COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU, and are strongly suggestive of increasing the prophylaxis towards high-prophylactic doses, even in the absence of randomized evidence.},

abstract = {As insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is present in the alpha granules of platelets and its receptor is expressed on the platelet surface, it may contribute to the amplification of platelet responses and pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. The functional and signaling pathways that are involved in IGF-1 modulation of platelet function, however, are presently unknown. Here, I report that IGF-1 stimulation of platelets results in dose-dependent phosphorylation of the IGF receptor in the range of 1 to 100 nM. Phosphorylation of the IGF receptor is rapid and sustained, with maximal phosphorylation reached within 1 minute. Furthermore, IGF-1 stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and IRS-2 and their association with the p85 subunit of phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K). IGF-1-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2 and subsequent p85 binding is transient and precedes phosphorylation of protein kinase B (PKB) on Ser473. PAR-1-mediated platelet aggregation is potentiated by IGF-1 and this potentiation, together with PKB phosphorylation, is abolished by the PI3Kalpha inhibitors PI-103 and PIK-75. Importantly, the IGF receptor inhibitor NVP-AEW541 and the neutralization antibody alphaIR3 inhibit SFLLRN-stimulated aggregation, implicating IGF-1 in autocrine regulation of platelet function. These results demonstrate that IGF-1 activates the IGF receptor/IRS/PI3K/PKB pathway, and that PI3Kalpha is essential for the potentiatory effect of IGF-1 on platelet responses.},

Here, using multiple models of vascular injury, we found that time to arterial thrombotic occlusion was markedly prolonged in Mrp14-/- mice. We observed that MRP-14 and MRP-8/ MRP-14 heterodimers (S100A8/A9) are expressed in and secreted by platelets from WT mice and that thrombus formation was reduced in whole blood from Mrp14-/- mice. Infusion of WT platelets, purified MRP-14, or purified MRP-8/MRP-14 heterodimers into Mrp14-/- mice decreased the time to carotid artery occlusion after injury, indicating that platelet-derived MRP-14 directly regulates thrombosis. In contrast, infusion of purified MRP-14 into mice deficient for both MRP-14 and CD36 failed to reduce carotid occlusion times, indicating that CD36 is required for MRP-14-dependent thrombosis. Our data identify a molecular pathway of thrombosis that involves platelet MRP-14 and CD36 and suggest that targeting MRP-14 has potential for treating atherothrombotic disorders, including MI and stroke.},

In addition, the frequency of microalbuminuria (Malb), hyperfiltration, and reduced renal functional reserve (RFR) was evaluated in adolescents with normal BP and untreated borderline and mild essential hypertension. Thirty-three normotensive (NT) adolescents, 14.5+/-2.1 years (mean +/- SD), and 29 untreated borderline and mildly hypertensive (HT) adolescents, 14.6+/-2.4 years, wore the SpaceLabs 90207 ambulatory BP monitor for 24 h. Left ventricular mass was measured by M-mode echocardiography and then indexed (LVMI) to the cube of height. Creatinine clearance (Clcr) and urine Malb was measured on 24 h collection and RFR by change in creatinine clearance after an oral protein load. Diurnal BP change was expressed as the absolute and percent day-night BP fall and cusum derived plot height (CPH) and circadian alteration magnitude (CDCAM). Groups were compared using analysis of covariance with adjustments for race, gender, and body mass index. All NT and 19 HT subjects (HT-1) had normal LVMI at 22.2+/-5.3 and 25.8+/-3.8 g/m3, respectively. Ten HT (HT-2) had increased LVMI of 36.9+/-5.2 g/m3. No significant difference was found for absolute or percent day-night BP fall or CDCAM between groups. Nocturnal systolic BP was correlated most closely with LVMI (r = 0.41, p = .001). Clcr, Malb, and RFR did not differ between the groups. In conclusion, adolescents with borderline and mild essential hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy have similar levels of diurnal BP fall, urine Malb excretion, and RFR compared to normotensive and hypertensive adolescents with normal left ventricular mass.},

We prospectively included 912 STEMI patients (663 male and 249 female; mean age 58.7 ± 12.4 years) who underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention. The patients were divided into 3 groups according to MPV tertiles. Highest SYNTAX score (SS) was observed in MPVhigh group compared with MPVmid and MPVlow groups (P {\textless} .001 for all). The SS of MPVmid group was higher than MPVlow group (P = .036). The MPV in diabetic STEMI patients was higher than in nondiabetic STEMI patients (P {\textless} .001). Multivariate linear regression analysis showed that the MPV was associated with diabetes ($\beta$ = .115, P = .001), troponin level ($\beta$ = .131, P = .001), platelet count ($\beta$ = -.241, P {\textless} .001), and SS ($\beta$ = .216, P {\textless} .001).

Therefore, we hypothesized that raised leptin levels may identify men at increased risk of a coronary event in the West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study (WOSCOPS). Methods and Results- Plasma leptin levels were measured at baseline in 377 men (cases) who subsequently experienced a coronary event and in 783 men (controls) who remained free of an event during the 5-year follow-up period of the study. Controls were matched to cases on the basis of age and smoking history and were representative of the entire WOSCOPS cohort. Leptin levels were significantly higher in cases than controls (5.87+/-2.04 ng/mL versus 5.04+/-2.09 ng/mL, P{\textless}0.001). In univariate analysis, for each 1 SD increase in leptin, the relative risk (RR) of an event increased by 1.25 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.10 to 1.43; P{\textless}0.001). There was minimal change in this RR with correction for body mass index (RR, 1.24; 95{\%} CI, 1.06 to 1.45; P=0.006) or with further correction for classic risk factors, including age, lipids, and systolic blood pressure (RR, 1.20; 95{\%} CI, 1.02 to 1.42; P=0.03). Leptin correlated with C-reactive protein (r=0.24, P{\textless}0.001) and, even with this variable added to the model, leptin retained significance as a predictor of coronary events (RR, 1.18; 95{\%} CI, 1.00 to 1.39; P=0.05) at the expense of C-reactive protein.|We show, for the first time, in a large prospective study that leptin is a novel, independent risk factor for coronary heart disease.},

abstract = {In heart failure (HF), angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT(1)-R) expression is upregulated in brain regions regulating sympathetic drive, blood pressure, and body fluid homeostasis. However, the mechanism by which brain AT(1)-R are upregulated in HF remains unknown. The present study examined the hypothesis that the angiotensin II (Ang II)-triggered mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) p44/42, p38, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase contribute to upregulation of the AT(1)-R in the hypothalamus of rats with HF. AT(1)-R protein, AT(1)-R mRNA, and AT(1)-R immunoreactivity increased in the paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus and the subfornical organ of rats with ischemia-induced HF compared with sham-operated controls. Phosphorylated p44/42 MAPK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and p38 MAPK also increased in paraventricular nucleus and subfornical organ. A 4-week ICV infusion of the AT(1)-R antagonist losartan decreased AT(1)-R protein and phosphorylation of p44/42 MAPK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and p38 MAPK in the HF rats. A 4-week ICV infusion of the p44/42 MAPK inhibitor PD98059 or the c-Jun N-terminal kinase inhibitor SP600125 significantly decreased AT(1)-R protein and AT(1)-R immunoreactivity in the paraventricular nucleus and subfornical organ, but the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 did not. Treatment with ICV losartan, PD98059, and SP600125 had no effect on AT(1)-R expression by Western blot in sham-operated rats. In untreated HF rats 4 weeks after coronary ligation, a 3-hour ICV infusion of PD98059, SP600125, or losartan reduced AT(1)-R mRNA in paraventricular nucleus and subfornical organ. These data indicate that MAPK plays an important role in the upregulation of AT(1)-R in the rat forebrain in HF and suggest that Ang II upregulates its own receptor by this mechanism.},

abstract = {Background: The optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after percutaneous coronary intervention with drug-eluting stents remains uncertain. We compared short-term ({\textless}6-month) DAPT followed by aspirin or P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy; midterm (6-month) DAPT; 12-month DAPT; and extended-term ({\textgreater}12-month) DAPT after percutaneous coronary intervention with drug-eluting stents. Methods: Twenty-four randomized, controlled trials were selected using Medline, Embase, Cochrane library, and online databases through September 2019. The coprimary end points were myocardial infarction and major bleeding, which constituted the net clinical benefit. A frequentist network meta-analysis was conducted with a random-effects model. Results: In 79 073 patients, at a median follow-up of 18 months, extended-term DAPT was associated with a reduced risk of myocardial infarction in comparison with 12-month DAPT (absolute risk difference, -3.8 incident cases per 1000 person-years; relative risk, 0.68 [95{\%} CI, 0.54-0.87]), midterm DAPT (absolute risk difference, -4.6 incident cases per 1000 person-years; relative risk, 0.61 [0.45-0.83]), and short-term DAPT followed by aspirin monotherapy (absolute risk difference, -6.1 incident cases per 1000 person-years; relative risk, 0.55 [0.37-0.83]), or P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy (absolute risk difference, -3.7 incident cases per 1000 person-years; relative risk, 0.69 [0.51-0.95]). Conversely, extended-term DAPT was associated with a higher risk of major bleeding than all other DAPT groups. In comparison with 12-month DAPT, no significant differences in the risks of ischemic end points or major bleeding were observed with midterm or short-term DAPT followed by aspirin monotherapy, with the exception that short-term DAPT followed by P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy was associated with a reduced risk of major bleeding. There were no significant differences with respect to mortality between the different DAPT strategies. In acute coronary syndrome, extended-term in comparison with 12-month DAPT was associated with a reduced risk of myocardial infarction without a significant increase in the risk of major bleeding. Conclusions: The present network meta-analysis suggests that, in comparison with 12-month DAPT, short-term DAPT followed by P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy reduces major bleeding after percutaneous coronary intervention with drug-eluting stents, whereas extended-term DAPT reduces myocardial infarction at the expense of more bleeding events.},

abstract = {Plasma leptin levels are elevated in most of obese individuals, and obesity is associated with high incidence of cardiovascular diseases. It has been reported that leptin is an independent risk factor for the coronary artery disease in obese patients and that leptin is involved in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. We previously reported that leptin promotes platelet aggregation. The present study aimed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying this effect of leptin using a megakaryoblast cell line, MEG-01 cells. Leptin receptors mRNAs expression in MEG-01 cells were analyzed by RT-PCR. Leptin-induced tyrosine-phosphorylation of proteins was analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. ADP-induced increases in cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) in the presence and absence of leptin were measured by dual-wavelength fura-2 microfluorometry. Both Ob-Ra and Ob-Rb, were expressed and leptin-induced tyrosine-phosphorylation of several proteins in MEG-01 cells. Leptin-potentiated increases in [Ca(2+)](i) induced by ADP. ADP at a subthreshold concentration and leptin acted synergistically in producing [Ca(2+)](i) increases. These effects of leptin on [Ca(2+)](i) were inhibited by blockers of JAK2 and tyrosine kinases. Furthermore, leptin increased the tyrosine-phosphorylation of Gq alpha-subunits. The results indicate that leptin enhances ADP-induced [Ca(2+)](i) increases via JAK2 and tyrosine kinases in a megakaryoblast cell line. This mechanism may underlie the potentiation of platelet aggregation by leptin.},

In this study, the effects of JTE-013, a specific antagonist of the migration-inhibitory receptor EDG-5, on Sph-1-P-elicited responses were examined in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs), which expressed EDG-5 protein weakly and abundantly, respectively. This pyrazolopyridine compound reversed the inhibitory effect of Sph-1-P on SMC migration and further enhanced Sph-1-P-stimulated HUVEC migration. In contrast, its effect on Sph-1-P-induced intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization was marginal. Our results indicate that specific regulation of Sph-1-P-modulated migration responses in vascular cells can be achieved by EDG-5 antagonists and that manipulation of Sph-1-P biological activities by each EDG antagonist may lead to a therapeutical application to control vascular diseases.},

abstract = {As insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is present in the alpha granules of platelets and its receptor is expressed on the platelet surface, it may contribute to the amplification of platelet responses and pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. The functional and signaling pathways that are involved in IGF-1 modulation of platelet function, however, are presently unknown. Here, I report that IGF-1 stimulation of platelets results in dose-dependent phosphorylation of the IGF receptor in the range of 1 to 100 nM. Phosphorylation of the IGF receptor is rapid and sustained, with maximal phosphorylation reached within 1 minute. Furthermore, IGF-1 stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and IRS-2 and their association with the p85 subunit of phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K). IGF-1-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2 and subsequent p85 binding is transient and precedes phosphorylation of protein kinase B (PKB) on Ser473. PAR-1-mediated platelet aggregation is potentiated by IGF-1 and this potentiation, together with PKB phosphorylation, is abolished by the PI3Kalpha inhibitors PI-103 and PIK-75. Importantly, the IGF receptor inhibitor NVP-AEW541 and the neutralization antibody alphaIR3 inhibit SFLLRN-stimulated aggregation, implicating IGF-1 in autocrine regulation of platelet function. These results demonstrate that IGF-1 activates the IGF receptor/IRS/PI3K/PKB pathway, and that PI3Kalpha is essential for the potentiatory effect of IGF-1 on platelet responses.},

We used microneurography (peroneal nerve) to directly record sympathetic nerve activity to muscle (mSNA) and also measured plasma norepinephrine levels in patients with heart failure and in normal control subjects. Our goal was to determine whether sympathetic nerve activity is increased in patients with heart failure and whether plasma norepinephrine levels correlate with levels of mSNA in heart failure. Resting muscle sympathetic nerve activity in 16 patients with moderate to severe heart failure (54 +/- 5 bursts/min, mean +/- SE) was significantly higher (p less than .01) than the levels of activity in either nine age-matched normal control subjects (25 +/- 4 bursts/min) or 19 "young" normal control subjects (24 +/- 2 bursts/min). We found a significant correlation between plasma norepinephrine levels and mSNA (r = .73, p less than .05).

abstract = {This paper examines relationships between metrics of visit-to-visit variability (VVV) of blood pressure (BP) to determine which metrics should be calculated in studies of the association of VVV with health outcomes. We examined correlation and agreement between quintiles for standard deviation (s.d.), standard deviation independent of the mean (SDIM), coefficient of variation (CV), successive variation (SV), average real variability (ARV), range, maximum, peak size and trough size of systolic BP in the Trial of Preventing Hypertension placebo arm (n=288). The average age of participants was 48 years. Mean systolic BP was 133.5 mm Hg. VVV metrics were all significantly correlated (P{\textless}0.001). Correlations between s.d., SDIM, CV and range and between ARV and SV were ≥0.90. Kappa statistics between quintiles of SD, SDIM, CV and range and between ARV and SV were ≥0.80. In studies of the relationship of VVV with health outcomes, we recommend reporting results for one of the metrics of overall variability (s.d., SDIM, CV), one of the metrics of variability between consecutive visits (SV, ARV), and one or more of the metrics of extreme values at a single visit (maximum, peak size, trough size).},

abstract = {Associations between modifiable exposures and disease seen in observational epidemiology are sometimes confounded and thus misleading, despite our best efforts to improve the design and analysis of studies. Mendelian randomization-the random assortment of genes from parents to offspring that occurs during gamete formation and conception-provides one method for assessing the causal nature of some environmental exposures. The association between a disease and a polymorphism that mimics the biological link between a proposed exposure and disease is not generally susceptible to the reverse causation or confounding that may distort interpretations of conventional observational studies. Several examples where the phenotypic effects of polymorphisms are well documented provide encouraging evidence of the explanatory power of Mendelian randomization and are described. The limitations of the approach include confounding by polymorphisms in linkage disequilibrium with the polymorphism under study, that polymorphisms may have several phenotypic effects associated with disease, the lack of suitable polymorphisms for studying modifiable exposures of interest, and canalization-the buffering of the effects of genetic variation during development. Nevertheless, Mendelian randomization provides new opportunities to test causality and demonstrates how investment in the human genome project may contribute to understanding and preventing the adverse effects on human health of modifiable exposures.},

abstract = {It is well established that the central cardiovascular effects of angiotensin II (Ang II) involve superoxide production. However, the intracellular mechanism by which reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling regulates neuronal Ang II actions remains to be elucidated. In the present study, we have used neuronal cells in primary cultures from the hypothalamus and brain stem areas to study the role of ROS on the cellular actions of Ang II. Ang II increases neuronal firing rate, an effect mediated by the AT(1) receptor subtype and involving inhibition of the delayed rectifier potassium current (I(Kv)). This increase in neuronal activity was associated with increases in NADPH oxidase activity and ROS levels within neurons, the latter evidenced by an increase in ethidium fluorescence. The increases in NADPH oxidase activity and ethidium fluorescence were blocked by either the AT(1) receptor antagonist losartan or by the selective NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitor gp91ds-tat. Extracellular application of the ROS scavenger, Tempol, attenuated the Ang II-induced increase in neuronal firing rate by 70{\%}. In addition, gp91ds-tat treatment resulted in a 50{\%} inhibition of Ang II-induced increase in firing rate. In contrast, the ROS generator Xanthine-Xanthine oxidase significantly increased neuronal firing rate. Finally, Ang II inhibited neuronal I(Kv,) and this inhibition was abolished by gp91ds-tat treatment. These observations demonstrate, for the first time, that Ang II regulates neuronal activity via a series of events that includes ROS generation and inhibition of I(Kv). This signaling seems to be a critical cellular event in central Ang II regulation of cardiovascular function.},

abstract = {Background: Variation in adiposity is associated with cardiometabolic disease outcomes, but the mechanisms leading from this exposure to disease are unclear. This study aimed to estimate effects of adiposity, proxied by body mass index (BMI), on an extensive set of circulating proteins using both observational and genetically informed analyses. Methods and findings: We used proteomic data from up to 2,737 healthy participants from the INTERVAL study of UK blood donors. Associations between self-reported BMI and 3,622 unique plasma proteins measured by the SomaLogic platform were explored using linear regression. These were complemented by Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses using a genetic risk score (GRS) comprised of 654 BMI-associated polymorphisms from a recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) of adult BMI. Observationally, BMI showed associations with 1,576 protein traits (Bonferroni corrected P {\textless} 1.4 x 10-5), with strong associations with leptin, fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4) and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG). The GRS for BMI was positively associated with self-reported BMI to the extent expected given its known genetic association (R2 = 0.028) and there was a lack of strong association between this GRS and measured confounding factors. MR analyses provided further evidence for a causal relationship between BMI and a range of measured proteins (eight in this analysis achieved P {\textless}1.4x10-5) including a strong relationship with leptin levels (0.63 standard deviation (SD) per SD BMI, 95{\%} CI 0.48 to 0.79, P = 1.6x10-15), FABP4 (0.64 SD per SD BMI, 95{\%} CI 0.46 to 0.83, P = 6.7x10-12) and SHBG abundance (-0.45 SD per SD BMI, 95{\%} CI -0.65 to -0.25, P = 1.4x10-5). There was strong agreement in the direction and magnitude of observational and MR estimates (R2 = 0.33) and evidence that proteins most strongly altered by BMI were enriched for genes involved in cardiovascular disease (1.14 fold enrichment, P = 1.3 x 10-4). Limitations of this particular set of analyses include a modest sample size and a derivation of measured BMI from self-reported height and weight. Conclusions: This study provides evidence for a broad impact of adiposity on the human proteome. Proteins most strongly altered by BMI include those which are involved in regulating appetite, sex hormones, and inflammation; such proteins are also enriched for genes related to cardiovascular disease. These results help to focus attention onto new potential targets for obesity-related disease prevention.Competing Interest StatementJohn Danesh sits on the International Cardiovascular and Metabolic Advisory Board for Novartis (since 2010); the Steering Committee of UK Biobank (since 2011); the MRC International Advisory Group (ING) member, London (since 2013); the MRC High Throughput Science Omics Panel Member, London (since 2013); the Scientific Advisory Committee for Sanofi (since 2013); the International Cardiovascular and Metabolism Research and Development Portfolio Committee for Novartis; and the Astra Zeneca Genomics Advisory Board (2018).Funding StatementFunding: This publication is the work of the authors who are guarantors for its contents.

abstract = {Acute lung injury (ALI) attributable to sepsis or mechanical ventilation and subacute lung injury because of ionizing radiation (RILI) share profound increases in vascular permeability as a key element and a common pathway driving increased morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, despite advances in the understanding of lung pathophysiology, specific therapies do not yet exist for the treatment of ALI or RILI, or for the alleviation of unremitting pulmonary leakage, which serves as a defining feature of the illness. A critical need exists for new mechanistic insights that can lead to novel strategies, biomarkers, and therapies to reduce lung injury. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a naturally occurring bioactive sphingolipid that acts extracellularly via its G protein-coupled S1P1-5 as well as intracellularly on various targets. S1P-mediated cellular responses are regulated by the synthesis of S1P, catalyzed by sphingosine kinases 1 and 2, and by the degradation of S1P mediated by lipid phosphate phosphatases, S1P phosphatases, and S1P lyase. We and others have demonstrated that S1P is a potent angiogenic factor that enhances lung endothelial cell integrity and an inhibitor of vascular permeability and alveolar flooding in preclinical animal models of ALI. In addition to S1P, S1P analogues such as 2-amino-2-(2-[4-octylphenyl]ethyl)-1,3-propanediol (FTY720), FTY720 phosphate, and FTY720 phosphonates offer therapeutic potential in murine models of lung injury. This translational review summarizes the roles of S1P, S1P analogues, S1P-metabolizing enzymes, and S1P receptors in the pathophysiology of lung injury, with particular emphasis on the development of potential novel biomarkers and S1P-based therapies for ALI and RILI.},

abstract = {Prediction of oxygen uptake (VO2) during exercise from relations established in normal subjects between VO2 and work load in watts (W) may be inaccurate in patients with chronic heart failure because these patients could manifest delayed VO2 kinetics at final stages of exercise. To test the hypothesis that even at low levels of work, patients exhibit a lower VO2 than do normal subjects, 77 patients with heart failure and 27 control subjects with a normal heart or with disease other than heart failure underwent bicycle exercise with respiratory gas analysis. Work load was increased by 10 W/min from an initial 20 W. VO2 (ml/min per kg) was measured every 15 s. The delta VO2/delta W ratio was significantly reduced only in the most severely impaired patients in heart failure class C-D (8.75 +/- 2.14 versus 11.05 +/- 0.38, p less than 0.05). Class B patients showed a lower ratio at a work load of greater than or equal to 80 W, whereas class C-D patients manifested a lower ratio at greater than or equal to 20 W. Even with a low incremental work rate protocol, compared with sedentary normal subjects or patients without heart failure, patients with heart failure demonstrate impaired oxygen uptake. This observation suggests the presence of anaerobic metabolism or delayed VO2 uptake, or both; accordingly, indirect estimates of VO2 requirements derived from intensity or duration of exercise in such patients are overestimated.},

abstract = {Ambulant 24 h blood pressure was recorded in 97 untreated hypertensive subjects (50 with, 47 without echocardiographic signs of left ventricular hypertrophy) and 45 matched normotensive subjects. Forearm vascular resistance was calculated from mean blood pressure and blood flow, which was measured by venous plethysmography during reactive hyperemia. Blood pressure variability was calculated by standard deviations of pressure values. Systolic 24 h blood pressure exhibited the closest correlation with left ventricular mass index in hypertensives (4 = 0.48; P {\textless} .001). No relation could be found between blood pressure fall during the night and left ventricular mass index. Furthermore, body weight was a significant correlate of left ventricular mass (r = 0.53; P {\textless} .001). Regression analysis indicated that body weight and 24 h blood pressure were the principal determinants of left ventricular mass. Blood pressure variability was significantly higher in hypertensive than in normotensive subjects (P {\textless} .05). The highest vascular resistance was found in hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy compared with the other groups (P {\textless} .05). A significant close correlation between systolic resting as well as 24 h blood pressure and vascular resistance was identified for the group of hypertensives and all subjects investigated. Furthermore, left ventricular mass index and vascular resistance were correlated (in hypertensives: r = 0.32; P {\textless} .01). The extent of left ventricular mass index and forearm vascular resistance are proportional to the severity of hypertension. As vascular resistance and left ventricular mass are also related, these findings could speak for a parallel development of total peripheral resistance and left ventricular hypertrophy in essential hypertension.},

Here we carried out a high-powered meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in up to 66,867 individuals of European ancestry, followed by extensive biological and functional assessment. We identified 68 genomic loci reliably associated with platelet count and volume mapping to established and putative novel regulators of megakaryopoiesis and platelet formation. These genes show megakaryocyte-specific gene expression patterns and extensive network connectivity. Using gene silencing in Danio rerio and Drosophila melanogaster, we identified 11 of the genes as novel regulators of blood cell formation. Taken together, our findings advance understanding of novel gene functions controlling fate-determining events during megakaryopoiesis and platelet formation, providing a new example of successful translation of GWAS to function.},

There is an evolving understanding of the mechanisms influencing vascular occlusion and the role of inflammation and immunity. Despite major advances in elucidating the mechanistic pathways mediating platelet function and thrombosis, challenges in the treatment of vascular occlusive diseases persist. Pharmacological advances have greatly affected thrombotic outcomes, but this has led to the unwanted side effect of bleeding. Detailed assessment of the impact of non-thrombotic diseases on haemostasis and thrombosis is necessary to better evaluate thrombotic risk and establish optimal treatment.

We previously showed that S1P was cardioprotective and that SphK was critical for myocardial ischemic preconditioning. Although DMS is an endogenous sphingolipid, its effect on cardiac function and cardioprotection at low concentration has not been studied.|In Langendorff-perfused wild-type and protein kinase C (PKC)epsilon-null mouse hearts, cardiac function, infarction size, and SphK activity were measured.|Pretreatment with 0.3 microM and 1 microM DMS for 10 min protected against ischemia/reperfusion injury. Cardiac function (LVDP, +/-dP/dtmax) was improved and infarction size was reduced. The cardiac protection induced by DMS was abolished in PKCepsilon-null mouse hearts. Administration of 1 microM DMS ex vivo increased cytosolic SphK activity. This enhanced SphK activity was abolished in PKCepsilon-null mouse hearts. DMS also increased PKCepsilon translocation from the particulate to the cytosolic fraction with no effect on PKCalpha distribution. Co-immunoprecipitation showed that SphK1 interacted with PKCepsilon phosphorylated on Ser729. DMS also increased cytosolic Akt phosphorylation (Ser 473) and Akt translocation from a Triton-insoluble fraction to the cytosol.|DMS has a biphasic effect on cardioprotection. Higher concentrations (10 microM) are inhibitory, whereas a low concentration (0.3 microM and 1 microM) of DMS protects murine hearts against ischemia/reperfusion injury. DMS activates SphK in the cytosol via a PKCepsilon dependent mechanism. The PKCepsilon-SphK-S1P-Akt pathway is involved in the cardiac protection induced by DMS.},

abstract = {Adiposity, assessed as elevated body mass index (BMI), is associated with increased risk of ischemic heart disease (IHD); however, whether this is causal is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that positive observational associations between BMI and IHD are causal.|In 75,627 individuals taken from two population-based and one case-control study in Copenhagen, we measured BMI, ascertained 11,056 IHD events, and genotyped FTO(rs9939609), MC4R(rs17782313), and TMEM18(rs6548238). Using genotypes as a combined allele score in instrumental variable analyses, the causal odds ratio (OR) between BMI and IHD was estimated and compared with observational estimates. The allele score-BMI and the allele score-IHD associations used to estimate the causal OR were also calculated individually. In observational analyses the OR for IHD was 1.26 (95{\%} CI 1.19-1.34) for every 4 kg/m(2) increase in BMI. A one-unit allele score increase associated with a 0.28 kg/m(2) (95 CI{\%} 0.20-0.36) increase in BMI and an OR for IHD of 1.03 (95{\%} CI 1.01-1.05) (corresponding to an average 1.68 kg/m(2) BMI increase and 18{\%} increase in the odds of IHD for those carrying all six BMI increasing alleles). In instrumental variable analysis using the same allele score the causal IHD OR for a 4 kg/m(2) increase in BMI was 1.52 (95{\%} CI 1.12-2.05).|For every 4 kg/m(2) increase in BMI, observational estimates suggested a 26{\%} increase in odds for IHD while causal estimates suggested a 52{\%} increase. These data add evidence to support a causal link between increased BMI and IHD risk, though the mechanism may ultimately be through intermediate factors like hypertension, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. This work has important policy implications for public health, given the continuous nature of the BMI-IHD association and the modifiable nature of BMI. This analysis demonstrates the value of observational studies and their ability to provide unbiased results through inclusion of genetic data avoiding confounding, reverse causation, and bias.},

However, the role of S100A8/A9 in the etiology of MI is not well understood. Here, we elaborate on the critical roles and potential mechanisms of S100A8/A9 driving the pathogenesis of MI. First, cellular source of S100A8/A9 in infarcted heart is discussed.

Moreover, the predictive value of S100A8/A9 for the risk of recurrence of cardiovascular events is elucidated. Therefore, this review focuses on the molecular mechanisms of S100A8/A9 in MI pathogenesis to provide a promising biomarker and therapeutic target for MI.},

CCL2 increased the phosphorylation levels of PKC$\alpha$ (Thr638), P38MAPK (Thr180/Tyr182) and HSP27 (S78/S82) in human platelets, which were abrogated by PKC$\alpha$ inhibitor (RO 318220) or P38MAPK inhibitor (SB 203580).

abstract = {Microglia express three isoforms of the NADPH oxidase, Nox1, Nox2 and Nox4, with the potential to produce superoxide (O(2) ˙(-) ). Microglia also express neurotransmitter receptors, which can modulate microglial responses. In this study, microglial activity of Nox1, Nox2 and Nox4 in primary rat cultured microglia or the rodent BV2 cell line were altered by microglial neurotransmitter receptor modulation. Glutamate, GABA or ATP triggered microglial O(2) ˙(-) production via Nox activation. Nox activation was elicited by agonists of metabotropic mGlu3 receptors and by group III receptors, by GABA(A) but not GABA(B) receptors, and by purinergic P2X(7) or P2Y(2/4) receptors but not P2Y(1) receptors, and inhibited by metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 antagonists. The neurotransmitters also modulated Nox mRNA expression and NADPH activity. The activation of Nox by BzATP or GABA promoted a neuroprotective phenotype whilst the activation of Nox by glutamate promoted a neurotoxic phenotype. Taken together, these data indicate that microglial neurotransmitter receptors can signal via Nox to promote neuroprotection or neurotoxicity. This has implications for the subsequent neurotoxic profile of microglia when neurotransmitter levels may become skewed in neurodegeneration.},

abstract = {A number of regression situations in fish and fishery biology are examined, in which both of the variates are subject to error of measurement, or inherent variability, or both. For most of these situations a functional regression line is more suitable than the ordinary predictive regressions that have usually been employed, so that many estimates now in use are in some degree biased. Examples are (1) estimation of the exponent in the weight:length relationship, where almost all published values are somewhat too small; and (2) estimating the regression of logarithm of metabolic rate on log body weight of fish, where the best average figure proves to be 0.85 rather than 0.80. In the very common situation where the distribution of the variates is non-normal and open-ended, a functional regression is the most appropriate one even for purposes of prediction. Two ways of estimating the functional regression are (1) from arithmetic means of segments of the distribution, when computed symmetrically; and (2) from the geometric mean of one predictive regression and the reciprocal of the other. The GM regression gives a more accurate estimate when it is applicable; it is appropriate in all situations where the variability is mainly inherent in the material (little of it due to errors of measurement), or where the measurement variances are approximately proportional to the total variance of each variate; and it is the best estimate available for short series with moderate or large variability even when neither of these conditions applies. When error in X results solely from the measuring process the predictive regression of Y on X is also the functional regression if observations of X are not taken at random but rather have pre-established values, as is usual in experimental work. The uses of the various regressions are summarized in Table 8.},

In women, the body mass index and fat mass were higher throughout decades, and we observed a similar decrease to that in men in total IGF-I, free IGF-I and IGFBP3. In men with obesity, as measured by body fat, free IGF-I concentrations were lower than those without obesity; in women with obesity, total IGF-I concentrations and free IGF-I concentrations were lower than in those with obesity.

abstract = {Rationale: Obesity is a risk factor for atherothrombosis and various cancers. However, the mechanisms are not yet completely clarified. Objectives: We aimed to verify whether the microparticles (MPs) released from thrombin-activated platelets differed in obese and non-obese women for number, size, and proteomics cargo and the capacity to modulate in vitro the expression of (i) genes related to the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the endothelial to mesenchymal transition (EndMT), and (ii) cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 involved in the production of angiogenic and inflammatory mediators. Methods and Results: MPs were obtained from thrombin activated platelets of four obese and their matched non-obese women. MPs were analyzed by cytofluorimeter and protein content by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. MPs from obese women were not different in number but showed increased heterogeneity in size. In obese individuals, MPs containing mitochondria (mitoMPs) expressed lower CD41 levels and increased phosphatidylserine associated with enhanced Factor V representing a signature of a prothrombotic state. Proteomics analysis identified 44 proteins downregulated and three upregulated in MPs obtained from obese vs. non-obese women. A reduction in the proteins of the $\alpha$-granular membrane and those involved in mitophagy and antioxidant defenses-granular membrane was detected in the MPs of obese individuals. MPs released from platelets of obese individuals were more prone to induce the expression of marker genes of EMT and EndMT when incubated with human colorectal cancer cells (HT29) and human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (HCMEC), respectively. A protein, highly enhanced in obese MPs, was the pro-platelet basic protein with pro-inflammatory and tumorigenic actions. Exclusively MPs from obese women induced COX-2 in HCMEC. Conclusion: Platelet-derived MPs of obese women showed higher heterogeneity in size and contained different levels of proteins relevant to thrombosis and tumorigenesis. MPs from obese individuals presented enhanced capacity to cause changes in the expression of EMT and EndMT marker genes and to induce COX-2. These effects might contribute to the increased risk for the development of thrombosis and multiple malignancies in obesity.},

Methods: We performed 2-sample and multivariable Mendelian randomization to assess the causal effect of 12 lifestyle factors on risk of stroke and whether these effects are independent. Results: Genetically predicted years of education was inversely associated with ischemic, large artery, and small vessel stroke, and intracerebral hemorrhage. Genetically predicted smoking, body mass index, and waist-hip ratio were associated with ischemic and large artery stroke. The effects of education, body mass index, and smoking on ischemic stroke were independent. Conclusions: Our findings support the hypothesis that reduced education and increased smoking and obesity increase risk of ischemic, large artery, and small vessel stroke, suggesting that lifestyle modifications addressing these risk factors will reduce stroke risk.},

Over 11.3 years (median), 1242 deaths (487 cardiovascular) occurred, and 1049, 577, 421, and 457 participants experienced a fatal or nonfatal cardiovascular, cardiac, or coronary event or a stroke.

The purpose of the present study was to test the hypotheses: 1) exercise training (ET) alters the muscle metaboreflex and mechanoreflex control of muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) in HF patients. 2) The alteration in metaboreflex control is accompanied by increased expression of TRPV1 and CB1 receptors in skeletal muscle. 3) The alteration in mechanoreflex control is accompanied by COX-2 pathway in skeletal muscle. Thirty-four consecutive HF patients with ejection fractions {\textless}40{\%} were randomized to untrained (n = 17; 54 ± 2 yr) or exercise-trained (n = 17; 56 ± 2 yr) groups. MSNA was recorded by microneurography. Mechanoreceptors were activated by passive exercise and metaboreceptors by postexercise circulatory arrest (PECA). COX-2 pathway, TRPV1, and CB1 receptors were measured in muscle biopsies. Following ET, resting MSNA was decreased compared with untrained group. During PECA (metaboreflex), MSNA responses were increased, which was accompanied by the expression of TRPV1 and CB1 receptors. During passive exercise (mechanoreflex), MSNA responses were decreased, which was accompanied by decreased expression of COX-2, prostaglandin-E2 receptor-4, and thromboxane-A2 receptor and by decreased in muscle inflammation, as indicated by increased miRNA-146 levels and the stable NF-$\kappa$B/I$\kappa$B-$\alpha$ ratio. In conclusion, ET alters muscle metaboreflex and mechanoreflex control of MSNA in HF patients.

abstract = {Background Body-mass index (BMI) and diabetes have increased worldwide, whereas global average blood pressure and cholesterol have decreased or remained unchanged in the past three decades. We quantified how much of the effects of BMI on coronary heart disease and stroke are mediated through blood pressure, cholesterol, and glucose, and how much is independent of these factors. Methods We pooled data from 97 prospective cohort studies that collectively enrolled 1{\textperiodcentered}8 million participants between 1948 and 2005, and that included 57 161 coronary heart disease and 31 093 stroke events. For each cohort we excluded participants who were younger than 18 years, had a BMI of lower than 20 kg/m2, or who had a history of coronary heart disease or stroke. We estimated the hazard ratio (HR) of BMI on coronary heart disease and stroke with and without adjustment for all possible combinations of blood pressure, cholesterol, and glucose. We pooled HRs with a random-effects model and calculated the attenuation of excess risk after adjustment for mediators. Findings The HR for each 5 kg/m2 higher BMI was 1{\textperiodcentered}27 (95{\%} CI 1{\textperiodcentered}23-1{\textperiodcentered}31) for coronary heart disease and 1{\textperiodcentered}18 (1{\textperiodcentered}14-1{\textperiodcentered}22) for stroke after adjustment for confounders. Additional adjustment for the three metabolic risk factors reduced the HRs to 1{\textperiodcentered}15 (1{\textperiodcentered}12-1{\textperiodcentered}18) for coronary heart disease and 1{\textperiodcentered}04 (1{\textperiodcentered}01-1{\textperiodcentered}08) for stroke, suggesting that 46{\%} (95{\%} CI 42-50) of the excess risk of BMI for coronary heart disease and 76{\%} (65-91) for stroke is mediated by these factors. Blood pressure was the most important mediator, accounting for 31{\%} (28-35) of the excess risk for coronary heart disease and 65{\%} (56-75) for stroke. The percentage excess risks mediated by these three mediators did not differ significantly between Asian and western cohorts (North America, western Europe, Australia, and New Zealand). Both overweight (BMI ≥25 to {\textless}30 kg/m2) and obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m2) were associated with a significantly increased risk of coronary heart disease and stroke, compared with normal weight (BMI ≥20 to {\textless}25 kg/m2), with 50{\%} (44-58) of the excess risk of overweight and 44{\%} (41-48) of the excess risk of obesity for coronary heart disease mediated by the selected three mediators. The percentages for stroke were 98{\%} (69-155) for overweight and 69{\%} (64-77) for obesity. Interpretation Interventions that reduce high blood pressure, cholesterol, and glucose might address about half of excess risk of coronary heart disease and three-quarters of excess risk of stroke associated with high BMI. Maintenance of optimum bodyweight is needed for the full benefits.},

abstract = {Purpose. Evaluate the effects of weight loss on muscle mass and area, muscle fat infiltration, strength, and their association with physical function. Methods. Thirty-six overweight to moderately obese, sedentary older adults were randomized into either a physical activity plus weight loss (PA+WL) or physical activity plus successful aging health education (PA+SA) program. Measurements included body composition by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, computerized tomography, knee extensor strength, and short physical performance battery (SPPB). Results. At 6 months, PA+WL lost greater thigh fat and muscle area compared to PA+SA. PA+WL lost 12.4{\%} strength; PA+SA lost 1.0{\%}. Muscle fat infiltration decreased significantly in PA+WL and PA+SA. Thigh fat area decreased 6-fold in comparison to lean area in PA+WL. Change in total SPPB score was strongly inversely correlated with change in fat but not with change in lean or strength. Conclusion. Weight loss resulted in additional improvements in function over exercise alone, primarily due to loss of body fat. {\textcopyright} 2011 Adam J. Santanasto et al.},

Meta-analysis has been used historically in MR to combine results from separate epidemiological studies, with each study using a small but select group of genetic variants. In recent years, it has been used to combine genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary data for large numbers of genetic variants. Heterogeneity among the causal estimates obtained from multiple genetic variants points to a possible violation of the necessary instrumental variable assumptions. In this article, we provide a basic introduction to MR and the instrumental variable theory that it relies upon. We then describe how random effects models, meta-regression, and robust regression are being used to test and adjust for heterogeneity in order to improve the rigor of the MR approach.},

We prospectively studied the association between the morning blood pressure (BP) surge and stroke in elderly hypertensives.|We studied stroke prognosis in 519 older hypertensives in whom ambulatory BP monitoring was performed and silent cerebral infarct was assessed by brain MRI and who were followed up prospectively. The morning BP surge (MS) was calculated as follows: mean systolic BP during the 2 hours after awakening minus mean systolic BP during the 1 hour that included the lowest sleep BP. During an average duration of 41 months (range 1 to 68 months), 44 stroke events occurred. When the patients were divided into 2 groups according to MS, those in the top decile (MS group; MS {\textgreater} or =55 mm Hg, n=53) had a higher baseline prevalence of multiple infarcts (57{\%} versus 33{\%}, P=0.001) and a higher stroke incidence (19{\%} versus 7.3{\%}, P=0.004) during the follow-up period than the others (non-MS group; MS {\textless}55 mm Hg, n=466). After they were matched for age and 24-hour BP, the relative risk of the MS group versus the non-MS group remained significant (relative risk=2.7, P=0.04). The MS was associated with stroke events independently of 24-hour BP, nocturnal BP dipping status, and baseline prevalence of silent infarct (P=0.008).|In older hypertensives, a higher morning BP surge is associated with stroke risk independently of ambulatory BP, nocturnal BP falls, and silent infarct.

During 12.7 million person-years at risk, there were about 56000 vascular deaths (12000 stroke, 34000 ischaemic heart disease [IHD], 10000 other vascular) and 66000 other deaths at ages 40-89 years. Meta-analyses, involving "time-dependent" correction for regression dilution, related mortality during each decade of age at death to the estimated usual blood pressure at the start of that decade.|Within each decade of age at death, the proportional difference in the risk of vascular death associated with a given absolute difference in usual blood pressure is about the same down to at least 115 mm Hg usual systolic blood pressure (SBP) and 75 mm Hg usual diastolic blood pressure (DBP), below which there is little evidence. At ages 40-69 years, each difference of 20 mm Hg usual SBP (or, approximately equivalently, 10 mm Hg usual DBP) is associated with more than a twofold difference in the stroke death rate, and with twofold differences in the death rates from IHD and from other vascular causes. All of these proportional differences in vascular mortality are about half as extreme at ages 80-89 years as at ages 40-49 years, but the annual absolute differences in risk are greater in old age. The age-specific associations are similar for men and women, and for cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral ischaemia. For predicting vascular mortality from a single blood pressure measurement, the average of SBP and DBP is slightly more informative than either alone, and pulse pressure is much less informative.|Throughout middle and old age, usual blood pressure is strongly and directly related to vascular (and overall) mortality, without any evidence of a threshold down to at least 115/75 mm Hg.},

abstract = {In vivo and in vitro studies suggest a crucial role for Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) and its receptors in the development of the nervous system. Dihydrosphingosine 1-phosphate (dhS1P), a reduced form of S1P, is an agonist at S1P receptors, but the pharmacology and physiology of dhS1P has not been widely studied. The mycotoxin fumonisin B1 (FB(1)) is a potent inhibitor of ceramide synthases and causes selective accumulation of dihydrosphingosine and dhS1P. Recent studies suggest that maternal exposure to FB(1) correlates with the development of neural tube defects (NTDs) in which the neural epithelial progenitor cell layers of the developing brain fail to fuse. We hypothesize that the altered balance of S1P and dhS1P in neural epithelial cells contributes to the developmental effects of FB(1). The goal of this work was first to define the effect of FB(1) exposure on levels of sphingosine and dh-sphingosine and their receptor-active 1-phosphate metabolites in human embryonic stem cell-derived neural epithelial progenitor (hES-NEP) cells; and second, to define the relative activity of dhS1P and S1P in hES-NEP cells. We found that dhS1P is a more potent stimulator of inhibition of cAMP and Smad phosphorylation than is S1P in neural progenitors, and this difference in apparent potency may be due, in part, to more persistent presence of extracellular dhS1P applied to human neural progenitors rather than a higher activity at S1P receptors. This study establishes hES-NEP cells as a useful human in vitro model system to study the mechanism of FB(1) toxicity and the molecular pharmacology of sphingolipid signaling.

abstract = {Platelet adhesion, activation and aggregation play a pivotal role in atherothrombosis. Intracoronary atherothrombosis is the most common cause of the development of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and plays a central role in complications occurring around percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) including recurrent ACS, procedure-related myocardial infarction or stent thrombosis. Inhibition of platelet aggregation by medical treatment impairs formation and progression of thrombotic processes and is therefore of great importance in the prevention of complications after an ACS or around PCI. An essential part in the platelet activation process is the interaction of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) with the platelet P2Y12 receptor. The P2Y12 receptor is the predominant receptor involved in the ADP-stimulated activation of the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor. Activation of the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor results in enhanced platelet degranulation and thromboxane production, and prolonged platelet aggregation. The objectives of this review are to discuss the pharmacological limitations of the P2Y12 inhibitor clopidogrel, and describe the novel alternative P2Y12 inhibitors prasugrel and ticagrelor and the clinical implications of the introduction of these new medicines.},

abstract = {Whole-genome association studies (WGAS) bring new computational, as well as analytic, challenges to researchers. Many existing genetic-analysis tools are not designed to handle such large data sets in a convenient manner and do not necessarily exploit the new opportunities that whole-genome data bring. To address these issues, we developed PLINK, an open-source C/C++ WGAS tool set. With PLINK, large data sets comprising hundreds of thousands of markers genotyped for thousands of individuals can be rapidly manipulated and analyzed in their entirety. As well as providing tools to make the basic analytic steps computationally efficient, PLINK also supports some novel approaches to whole-genome data that take advantage of whole-genome coverage. We introduce PLINK and describe the five main domains of function: data management, summary statistics, population stratification, association analysis, and identity-by-descent estimation. In particular, we focus on the estimation and use of identity-by-state and identity-by-descent information in the context of population-based whole-genome studies. This information can be used to detect and correct for population stratification and to identify extended chromosomal segments that are shared identical by descent between very distantly related individuals. Analysis of the patterns of segmental sharing has the potential to map disease loci that contain multiple rare variants in a population-based linkage analysis.},

abstract = {Estimates of the marginal effect of measures of adiposity such as body mass index (BMI) on healthcare costs are important for the formulation and evaluation of policies targeting adverse weight profiles. Most estimates of this association are affected by endogeneity bias. We use a novel identification strategy exploiting Mendelian Randomization – random germline genetic variation modelled using instrumental variables – to identify the causal effect of BMI on inpatient hospital costs. Using data on over 300,000 individuals, the effect size per person per marginal unit of BMI per year varied according to specification, including {\pounds}21.22 (95{\%} confidence interval (CI): {\pounds}14.35-{\pounds}28.07) for conventional inverse variance weighted models to {\pounds}18.85 (95{\%} CI: {\pounds}9.05-{\pounds}28.65) for penalized weighted median models. Effect sizes from Mendelian Randomization models were larger in most cases than non-instrumental variable multivariable adjusted estimates ({\pounds}13.47, 95{\%} CI: {\pounds}12.51-{\pounds}14.43). There was little evidence of non-linearity. Within-family estimates, intended to address dynastic biases, were imprecise.},

The participants were classified into 3 groups: healthy pregnant women (n=816), pregnant women with mild PE (n=59), and pregnant women with severe PE (n=60). Blood samples were collected during antenatal care or at the time of admission, and the platelet indices were compared among the three groups.|Among the three groups, the platelet count and plateletcrit decreased as the disease progressed. The mean platelet volume and the PDW, however, increased as the disease progressed. When compared to the levels of other platelet indices, the PDW showed significant elevation in the severe PE group. In the mild and severe PE groups, the PDW was statistically correlated with the mean arterial pressure (MAP) (r=0.231, p{\textless}0.05), whereas other platelet indices were not. In the receiver operating characteristics curve analysis, the area under the curve of the PDW to predict severe PE was 0.74.|Among platelet indices, the PDW is significantly higher in women with severe PE than in women with mild PE, and is positively correlated with the MAP. Therefore, the PDW can serve as a candidate marker for predicting the severity of PE.},

abstract = {When missing data occur in one or more covariates in a regression model, multiple imputation (MI) is widely advocated as an improvement over complete-case analysis (CC). We use theoretical arguments and simulation studies to compare these methods with MI implemented under a missing at random assumption. When data are missing completely at random, both methods have negligible bias, and MI is more efficient than CC across a wide range of scenarios. For other missing data mechanisms, bias arises in one or both methods. In our simulation setting, CC is biased towards the null when data are missing at random. However, when missingness is independent of the outcome given the covariates, CC has negligible bias and MI is biased away from the null. With more general missing data mechanisms, bias tends to be smaller for MI than for CC. Since MI is not always better than CC for missing covariate problems, the choice of method should take into account what is known about the missing data mechanism in a particular substantive application. Importantly, the choice of method should not be based on comparison of standard errors. We propose new ways to understand empirical differences between MI and CC, which may provide insights into the appropriateness of the assumptions underlying each method, and we propose a new index for assessing the likely gain in precision from MI: the fraction of incomplete cases among the observed values of a covariate (FICO).},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Congestive heart failure (CHF) is an increasing public health problem. METHODS AND RESULTS: Among Framingham Heart Study subjects who were free of CHF at baseline, we determined the lifetime risk for developing overt CHF at selected index ages. We followed 3757 men and 4472 women from 1971 to 1996 for 124 262 person-years; 583 subjects developed CHF and 2002 died without prior CHF. At age 40 years, the lifetime risk for CHF was 21.0{\%} (95{\%} CI 18.7{\%} to 23.2{\%}) for men and 20.3{\%} (95{\%} CI 18.2{\%} to 22.5{\%}) for women. Remaining lifetime risk did not change with advancing index age because of rapidly increasing CHF incidence rates. At age 80 years, the lifetime risk was 20.2{\%} (95{\%} CI 16.1{\%} to 24.2{\%}) for men and 19.3{\%} (95{\%} CI 16.5{\%} to 22.2{\%}) for women. Lifetime risk for CHF doubled for subjects with blood pressure {\textgreater}/=160/100 versus {\textless}140/90 mm Hg. In a secondary analysis, we only considered those who developed CHF without an antecedent myocardial infarction; at age 40 years, the lifetime risk for CHF was 11.4{\%} (95{\%} CI 9.6{\%} to 13.2{\%}) for men and 15.4{\%} (95{\%} CI 13.5{\%} to 17.3{\%}) for women. CONCLUSIONS: When established clinical criteria are used to define overt CHF, the lifetime risk for CHF is 1 in 5 for both men and women. For CHF occurring in the absence of myocardial infarction, the lifetime risk is 1 in 9 for men and 1 in 6 for women, which highlights the risk of CHF that is largely attributable to hypertension. These results should assist in predicting the population burden of CHF and placing greater emphasis on prevention of CHF through hypertension control and prevention of myocardial infarction.},

Setting Nord-Tr{\o}ndelag Health (HUNT) Study (Norway) and UK Biobank (United Kingdom). Participants Middle to early late aged participants of European descent: 56 150 from the HUNT Study and 366 385 from UK Biobank. Main outcome measures All cause and cause specific (cardiovascular, cancer, and non-cardiovascular non-cancer) mortality. Results 12 015 and 10 344 participants died during a median of 18.5 and 7.0 years of follow-up in the HUNT Study and UK Biobank, respectively. Linear mendelian randomisation analyses indicated an overall positive association between genetically predicted BMI and the risk of all cause mortality. An increase of 1 unit in genetically predicted BMI led to a 5{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval 1{\%} to 8{\%}) higher risk of mortality in overweight participants (BMI 25.0-29.9) and a 9{\%} (4{\%} to 14{\%}) higher risk of mortality in obese participants (BMI ≥30.0) but a 34{\%} (16{\%} to 48{\%}) lower risk in underweight (BMI {\textless}18.5) and a 14{\%} (-1{\%} to 27{\%}) lower risk in low normal weight participants (BMI 18.5-19.9). Non-linear mendelian randomisation indicated a J shaped relation between genetically predicted BMI and the risk of all cause mortality, with the lowest risk at a BMI of around 22-25 for the overall sample. Subgroup analyses by smoking status, however, suggested an always-increasing relation of BMI with mortality in never smokers and a J shaped relation in ever smokers. Conclusions The previously observed J shaped relation between BMI and risk of all cause mortality appears to have a causal basis, but subgroup analyses by smoking status revealed that the BMI-mortality relation is likely comprised of at least two distinct curves, rather than one J shaped relation. An increased risk of mortality for being underweight was only evident in ever smokers.},

abstract = {Following a myocardial infarction (MI), inflammatory cytokines are elevated in the brain, as well as in plasma, indicating that inflammation is occurring in the brain in addition to the periphery. Microglia are the immune cells in the central nervous system and can produce cytokines when they are activated by an insult or injury. In the present study, we investigated whether MI in rats induces activation of microglia in the brain. We used immunohistochemistry to detect CD11b (clone OX-42) and morphological changes to identify activated microglia. Compared to control rats that had undergone sham surgical procedures, there was a significant increase in activated microglia in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) following myocardial infarction. Activated microglia were not observed in the ventral hypothalamus, adjacent to the PVN, nor in the cortex, indicating the response was not the result of a generalized inflammatory reaction in the brain. Echocardiography and haemodynamic parameters after myocardial infarction indicated that reduced left ventricular function but congestive heart failure had not developed. In conclusion, microglia are activated in the PVN but not in the adjacent hypothalamus following myocardial infarction. The activated microglia may contribute to the increased local production of pro-inflammatory cytokines observed in the PVN after myocardial infarction and resulting in reduced left ventricular function.},

abstract = {Essentials Near-patient testing improves coagulopathy diagnosis in cardiac surgery patients with severe bleeding. We investigated how well pre-emptive near-patient testing predicted severe bleeding. Severe bleeding could be predicted using both near-patient tests and patient clinical characteristics. Near-patient test results gave little additional predictive value over clinical characteristics alone. Background: Coagulopathic bleeding is common after cardiac surgery and is associated with increased morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs. Implementation of blood management algorithms in which patients with severe bleeding undergo near-patient coagulation testing results in less overall bleeding and transfusion. However, it is unknown whether there is additional value from pre-emptive near-patient testing to predict whether severe bleeding will occur. Objectives: To evaluate how well a comprehensive panel of 28 near-patient platelet and viscoelastometry tests predict bleeding after cardiac surgery, compared to prediction using baseline clinical characteristics alone. Methods: Single-center, prospective cohort study in adults undergoing a range of cardiac surgery procedures. The primary outcome was clinical concern about bleeding (CCB), a composite of high blood loss (chest drain volume {\textgreater}600 mL within 6 hours), re-operation for bleeding or administration of a pro-haemostatic treatment directed by clinician judgement. Results: In 1833 patients recruited between March 2010 and August 2012, the median number of abnormal near-patient test results was 5/28 per patient (range 0-18). CCB occurred in 449/1833 patients (24.5{\%}). The c-statistic for a predictive model for CCB using only baseline clinical characteristics (baseline-only model) was 0.72 (95{\%} CI 0.69-0.75). Addition of near-patient test results to this model (baseline-plus-test model) improved the prediction of CCB (c-statistic 0.75 [0.72-0.77]), but increased the number of correctly classified patients by only 18 (0.98{\%}). Conclusions: Near-patient coagulation testing predicts bleeding in cardiac surgery patients, but offers little improvement in prediction compared to baseline clinical characteristics alone. trial registration: ISRNCTN 20778544 (http://www.isrctn.com/).},

abstract = {The influence of reticulated platelets (RPs) on platelet inhibition by ticagrelor when compared with prasugrel is unknown. We aimed to determine the influence of RPs on adenosine diphosphate- (ADP-) induced platelet aggregation in patients with acute coronary syndrome who were randomly assigned to receive either ticagrelor or prasugrel for P2Y12 receptor inhibition.|One hundred and twenty-four patients were prospectively enrolled. The immature platelet fraction (IPF) was measured by an automated haematoanalyzer and platelet aggregation was assessed by multiple electrode aggregometry. In a subgroup of patients (n = 28) ADP-induced P-selectin expression was measured in dependence of the time point of study drug intake in RPs that were discriminated from mature platelets by thiazole-orange (TO) staining. The primary endpoint was the correlation of platelet aggregation and IPF in ticagrelor- vs. prasugrel-treated patients. Platelet aggregation significantly correlated with IPF in patients who received prasugrel (r = 0.41, P {\textless} 0.001). In contrast, no correlation between IPF and platelet aggregation was observed in ticagrelor-treated patients (r = 0.08, P = 0.51, P for difference of correlation coefficients P = 0.05). Within the TO-positive RP fraction, P-selectin expression was significantly higher in prasugrel when compared with ticagrelor-treated individuals (prasugrel 18.6 ± 16.0{\%} vs. ticagrelor 11.5 ± 6.0{\%}, P = 0.047). A time-dependent P-selectin expression was observed in prasugrel but not in ticagrelor-treated patients (prasugrel early 11.9 ± 9.4{\%} vs. late 26.3 ± 19.0{\%}, P = 0.031, ticagrelor early 9.6 ± 4.9{\%} vs. late 13.5 ± 6.6{\%}, P = 0.127).|Reticulated platelets show a greater impact on platelet reactivity in response to prasugrel when compared with ticagrelor.},

abstract = {Limited information exists about the consequences of hypertension during adulthood on residual life expectancy with cardiovascular disease. We aimed to analyze the life course of people with high blood pressure levels at age 50 in terms of total life expectancy and life expectancy with and without cardiovascular disease compared with normotensives. We constructed multistate life tables for cardiovascular disease, myocardial infarction, and stroke using data from 3128 participants of the Framingham Heart Study who had their 50th birthday while enrolled in the study. For the life table calculations, we used hazard ratios for 3 transitions (healthy to death, healthy to disease, and disease to death) by categories of blood pressure level and adjusted by age, sex, and confounders. Irrespective of sex, 50-year-old hypertensives compared with normotensives had a shorter life expectancy, a shorter life expectancy free of cardiovascular disease, myocardial infarction, and stroke, and a longer life expectancy lived with these diseases. Normotensive men (22{\%} of men) survived 7.2 years (95{\%} confidence interval, 5.6 to 9.0) longer without cardiovascular disease compared with hypertensives and spent 2.1 (0.9 to 3.4) fewer years of life with cardiovascular disease. Similar differences were observed in women. Compared with hypertensives, total life expectancy was 5.1 and 4.9 years longer for normotensive men and women, respectively. Increased blood pressure in adulthood is associated with large reductions in life expectancy and more years lived with cardiovascular disease. This effect is larger than estimated previously and affects both sexes similarly. Our findings underline the tremendous importance of preventing high blood pressure and its consequences in the population.},

abstract = {The obesity epidemic is responsible for a substantial economic burden in developed countries and is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The disease is the result not only of several environmental risk factors, but also of genetic predisposition. To take advantage of recent advances in gene-mapping technology, we executed a genome-wide association scan to identify genetic variants associated with obesity-related quantitative traits in the genetically isolated population of Sardinia. Initial analysis suggested that several SNPs in the FTO and PFKP genes were associated with increased BMI, hip circumference, and weight. Within the FTO gene, rs9930506 showed the strongest association with BMI (p = 8.6 ×10-7), hip circumference (p = 3.4 × 10-8), and weight (p = 9.1 × 10-7). In Sardinia, homozygotes for the rare "G" allele of this SNP (minor allele frequency = 0.46) were 1.3 BMI units heavier than homozygotes for the common "A" allele. Within the PFKP gene, rs6602024 showed very strong association with BMI (p = 4.9 × 10-6). Homozygotes for the rare "A" allele of this SNP (minor allele frequency = 0.12) were 1.8 BMI units heavier than homozygotes for the common "G" allele. To replicate our findings, we genotyped these two SNPs in the GenNet study. In European Americans (N = 1,496) and in Hispanic Americans (N = 839), we replicated significant association between rs9930506 in the FTO gene and BMI (p-value for meta-analysis of European American and Hispanic American follow-up samples, p = 0.001), weight (p = 0.001), and hip circumference (p = 0.0005). We did not replicate association between rs6602024 and obesity-related traits in the GenNet sample, although we found that in European Americans, Hispanic Americans, and African Americans, homozygotes for the rare "A" allele were, on average, 1.0-3.0 BMI units heavier than homozygotes for the more common "G" allele. In summary, we have completed a whole genome-association scan for three obesity-related quantitative traits and report that common genetic variants in the FTO gene are associated with substantial changes in BMI, hip circumference, and body weight. These changes could have a significant impact on the risk of obesity-related morbidity in the general population.},

abstract = {Our study aimed to explore whether left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), abnormal LV geometry and relative wall thickness (RWT) are associated with an increased risk of stroke in a hypertensive Chinese population. This study included 462 stroke patients and 3808 non-stroke hypertensive patients. LVH was diagnosed using the criteria of LV mass ⩾49.2 g m(-2.7) for men and 46.7 g m(-2.7) for women. A partition value of 0.43 was used for RWT. LV geometric patterns (normal, concentric remodeling, concentric or eccentric hypertrophy) were calculated according to LVH and RWT. Logistic regression analyses were used to determine the odds ratio (OR) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CI) of LVH, LV geometry abnormality and RWT for stroke. Our study suggested that LVH was associated with increased stroke risk (adjusted OR, 1.52; 95{\%} CI, 1.25-1.85; multivariate-adjusted OR, 1.43; 95{\%} CI, 1.16-1.75) and that concentric hypertrophy carried the highest risk of stroke (adjusted OR, 1.62; 95{\%} CI, 1.21-2.17), followed by eccentric hypertrophy (adjusted OR, 1.51; 95{\%} CI, 1.12-2.03), with concentric remodeling ranked third (adjusted OR, 1.34; 95{\%} CI, 1.01-1.80). RWT was associated with an increased risk of stroke and was independent of LVMI and other risk factors for stroke (adjusted OR, 3.97; 95{\%} CI, 1.10-14.34). Our observations in Chinese patients with hypertension indicated that LVH was an important risk factor for stroke, LV geometry abnormality was related to the presence of stroke, concentric hypertrophy carried the highest risk of stroke in cases of abnormal LV geometry and that RWT was also a risk factor for stroke and was independent of LVMI and other stroke risk factors.},

This Mendelian randomization study uses genetic variants as instruments to investigate whether there is a causal effect of genetically determined platelet count on CAD and ischemic stroke risk. Approach and Results- A genome-wide association study of 166 066 subjects was used to identify instruments and genetic association estimates for platelet count. Genetic association estimates for CAD and ischemic stroke were obtained from genome-wide association studies, including 60 801 CAD cases and 123 504 controls, and 60 341 ischemic stroke cases and 454 450 controls, respectively. The inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis of ratio method Mendelian randomization estimates was the main method used to obtain estimates for the causal effect of genetically determined platelet count on risk of cardiovascular outcomes. We found no significant Mendelian randomization effect of genetically determined platelet count on risk of CAD (odds ratio of CAD per SD unit increase in genetically determined platelet count, 1.01; 95{\%} CI, 0.98-1.04; P=0.60). However, higher genetically determined platelet count was causally associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke (odds ratio, 1.07; 95{\%} CI, 1.04-1.11; P{\textless}1×10},

The study compares the plasma and adipose tissue concentrations of total adiponectin, leptin, leptin receptor and leptin-to-adiponectin ratio (LAR) in morbidly obese patients. Additionally it evaluates selected adipokines (leptin, adiponectin), endothelial markers and LAR depending on the gender in morbidly obese and non-obese subjects. The study involved 51 patients (31 women aged 21 - 60 (mean age of 39) and 20 men aged 24 to 60 (mean age of 41)). The eligibility criterion included the BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2. The non-obese group consisted of 30 healthy volunteers with the BMI {\textless} 24.9 kg/m2; nineteen women, aged 24 - 53 (mean age of 41), and 11 men aged 21 - 52 (mean age of 38). In the plasma and adipose tissue, the concentrations of total adiponectin, leptin, leptin receptor and plasma soluble forms of E-selectin, P-selectin, thrombomodulin were measured applying immunoassay techniques. There were noted significantly higher plasma leptin and sE-selectin concentrations, leptin-to-adiponectin ratio, additionally lower concentrations of plasma leptin receptor and sP-selectin in obese subjects regardless of the gender. Significantly higher concentrations of total adiponectin, leptin, leptin receptor expressed per 1 mg of total protein in adipose tissue, as compared to plasma in morbidly obese patients, were observed. Significant positive correlations between the BMI and the concentration of leptin and between total adiponectin and sP-selectin were reported in the subject group. Similarly there were noted significant negative correlations between leptin receptor and the BMI and between leptin-to-adiponectin ratio and sP-selectin in obese patients. The study has shown that adiponectin has a positive impact on platelets through a possible reduction in sP-selectin, and thus on platelets activation. On the other hand an elevated sE-selectin reveals perspective about the endothelium stimulation and a higher risk of endothelial damage in morbidly obese patients. Also in morbidly obese the higher leptin level and leptin-to-adiponectin ratio and simultaneously lower concentration of leptin receptor are associated with leptin resistance, additionally in possible future risk of insulin resistance and diabetes type 2.},

abstract = {The present study provides first evidence on the role of plasma gelsolin in protecting pulmonary thromboembolism and thrombosis in a mouse model. Gelsolin is the most abundant actin depolymerizing protein in plasma and its significantly depleted values have been reported in metabolic disorders including cardiovascular diseases and myocardial infarction. Though gelsolin replacement therapy (GRT) has been shown to be effective in some animal models, no such study has been reported for thrombotic diseases that are acutely in need of bio-therapeutics for immediate and lasting relief. Here, using mice model and recombinant human gelsolin (rhuGSN), we demonstrate the antithrombotic effect of gelsolin in ferric chloride induced thrombosis in carotid artery and thrombin induced acute pulmonary thromboembolism. In thrombosis model, arterial occlusion time was significantly enhanced upon subcutaneous (SC) treatment with 8 mg of gelsolin per mice viz. 15.83 minutes vs. 8 minutes in the placebo group. Pertinently, histopathological examination showed channel formation within the thrombi in the carotid artery following injection of gelsolin. Fluorescence molecular tomography imaging further confirmed that administration of gelsolin reduced thrombus formation following carotid artery injury. In thrombin-induced acute pulmonary thromboembolism, mice pretreated with aspirin or gelsolin showed 100 and 83.33{\%} recovery, respectively. In contrast, complete mortality of mice was observed in vehicle treated group within 5 minutes of thrombin injection. Overall, our studies provide conclusive evidence on the thrombo-protective role of plasma gelsolin in mice model of pulmonary thromboembolism and thrombosis.},

abstract = {Triangulation is the practice of obtaining more reliable answers to research questions through integrating results from several different approaches, where each approach has different key sources of potential bias that are unrelated to each other. With respect to causal questions in aetiological epidemiology, if the results of different approaches all point to the same conclusion, this strengthens confidence in the finding. This is particularly the case when the key sources of bias of some of the approaches would predict that findings would point in opposite directions if they were due to such biases. Where there are inconsistencies, understanding the key sources of bias of each approach can help to identify what further research is required to address the causal question. The aim of this paper is to illustrate how triangulation might be used to improve causal inference in aetiological epidemiology. We propose a minimum set of criteria for use in triangulation in aetiological epidemiology, summarize the key sources of bias of several approaches and describe how these might be integrated within a triangulation framework. We emphasize the importance of being explicit about the expected direction of bias within each approach, whenever this is possible, and seeking to identify approaches that would be expected to bias the true causal effect in different directions. We also note the importance, when comparing results, of taking account of differences in the duration and timing of exposures. We provide three examples to illustrate these points.},

abstract = {Hemostasis and pathological thrombus formation are dynamic processes that require a co-ordinated series of events involving platelet membrane receptors, bidirectional intracellular signals, and release of platelet proteins and inflammatory substances. This review aims to summarize current knowledge in the key steps in the dynamics of thrombus formation, with special emphasis on the crucial participation of platelet receptors and signaling in this process. Initial tethering and firm adhesion of platelets to the exposed subendothelium is mediated by glycoprotein (GP) Ib/IX/V complex and collagen receptors, GP VI and alpha(2)beta(1) integrin, in the platelet surface, and by VWF and fibrillar collagen in the vascular site. Interactions between these elements are largely influenced by flow and trigger signaling events that reinforce adhesion and promote platelet activation. Thereafter, soluble agonists, ADP, thrombin, TxA(2), produced/released at the site of vascular injury act in autocrine and paracrine mode to amplify platelet activation and to recruit circulating platelets to the developing thrombus. Specific interactions of these agonists with their G-protein coupled receptors generate inside-out signaling leading to conformational activation of integrins, in particular alpha(IIb)beta(3), increasing their ligand affinity. Binding of alpha(IIb)beta(3) to its ligands, mainly fibrinogen, supports processes such as clot retraction and platelet aggregation. Stabilization of thrombi is supported by the late wave of signaling events promoted by close contact between aggregated platelets. The best known contact-dependent signaling is outside-in signaling through alphaIb beta(3), but new ones are being clarified such as those mediated by interaction of Eph receptors with ephrins, or by Sema 4D and Gas-6 binding to their receptors. Finally, newly identified mechanisms appear to control thrombus growth, including back-shifting of activated integrins and actuation of compensatory molecules such as ESAM or PECAM-1. The expanding knowledge of thrombotic disease is expected to translate into the development of new drugs to help management and prevention of thrombosis.},

Aim: This programme aimed to generate weight losses of {\textgreater}15 kg at 12 months, within routine primary care. Design and setting: Feasibility study in primary care. Method: Patients with a BMI {\textgreater}4 0 kg/m2 commenced a micronutrient-replete 810-833 kcal/day lowenergy liquid diet (LELD), delivered in primary care, for a planned 12 weeks or 20 kg weight loss (whichever was the sooner), with structured food reintroduction and then weight-loss maintenance, with optional orlistat to 12 months. Results: Of 91 patients (74 females) entering the programme (baseline: weight 131 kg, BMI 48 kg/m2, age 46 years), 58/91(64{\%}) completed the LELD stage, with a mean duration of 14.4 weeks (standard deviation [SD] = 6.0 weeks), and a mean weight loss of 16.9 kg (SD = 6.0 kg). Four patients commenced weight-loss maintenance omitting the food-reintroduction stage. Of the remaining 54, 37(68{\%}) started and completed food reintroduction over a mean duration of 9.3 weeks (SD = 5.7 weeks), with a further mean weight loss of 2.1 kg (SD = 3.7 kg), before starting a long-term low-fat-diet weight-loss maintenance plan. A total of 44/91 (48{\%}) received orlistat at some stage. At 12 months, weight was recorded for 68/91 (75{\%}) patients, with a mean loss of 12.4 kg (SD = 11.4 kg). Of these, 30 (33{\%} of all 91 patients starting the programme) had a documented maintained weight loss of {\textgreater}1 5 kg at 12 months, six (7{\%}) had a 10-15 kg loss, and 11 (12{\%}) had a 5-10 kg loss. The indicative cost of providing this entire programme for wider implementation would be {\pounds}861 per patient entered, or {\pounds}2611 per documented 15 kg loss achieved. Conclusion: A care package within routine primary care for severe obesity, including LELD, food reintroduction, and weight-loss maintenance, was well accepted and achieved a 12-monthmaintained weight loss of {\textgreater}15 kg for one-third of all patients entering the programme. {\textcopyright} British Journal of General Practice.},

abstract = {Genetic association studies, in particular the genome-wide association study (GWAS) design, have provided a wealth of novel insights into the aetiology of a wide range of human diseases and traits, in particular cardiovascular diseases and lipid biomarkers. The next challenge consists of understanding the molecular basis of these associations. The integration of multiple association datasets, including gene expression datasets, can contribute to this goal. We have developed a novel statistical methodology to assess whether two association signals are consistent with a shared causal variant. An application is the integration of disease scans with expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies, but any pair of GWAS datasets can be integrated in this framework. We demonstrate the value of the approach by re-analysing a gene expression dataset in 966 liver samples with a published meta-analysis of lipid traits including {\textgreater}100,000 individuals of European ancestry. Combining all lipid biomarkers, our re-analysis supported 26 out of 38 reported colocalisation results with eQTLs and identified 14 new colocalisation results, hence highlighting the value of a formal statistical test. In three cases of reported eQTL-lipid pairs (SYPL2, IFT172, TBKBP1) for which our analysis suggests that the eQTL pattern is not consistent with the lipid association, we identify alternative colocalisation results with SORT1, GCKR, and KPNB1, indicating that these genes are more likely to be causal in these genomic intervals. A key feature of the method is the ability to derive the output statistics from single SNP summary statistics, hence making it possible to perform systematic meta-analysis type comparisons across multiple GWAS datasets (implemented online at http://coloc.cs.ucl.ac.uk/coloc/). Our methodology provides information about candidate causal genes in associated intervals and has direct implications for the understanding of complex diseases as well as the design of drugs to target disease pathways. {\textcopyright} 2014 Giambartolomei et al.},

We recruited 30 participants (12 T2DM and 18 non-diabetic healthy controls). Participants underwent a meal tolerance test during which plasma glucose, insulin and serum C-peptide immunoreactivity were measured. We performed a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp and measured the glucose-disposal rate (GDR). The fasting serum levels of adiponectin, insulin-like growth factor-1, irisin, autotaxin, FABP4 and interleukin-6 were measured by ELISA. We found a strong negative correlation between FABP4 concentration and GDR in T2DM (r = -0.657, p = 0.020). FABP4 also was positively correlated with insulin secretion during the meal tolerance test in T2DM (IRI (120): r = 0.604, p = 0.038) and was positively related to the insulinogenic index in non-DM subjects (r = 0.536, p = 0.022). Autotaxin was also related to GDR. However, there was no relationship with insulin secretion. We found that serum FABP4 concentration were associated with insulin resistance and secretion in T2DM. This suggests that FABP4 may play an important role in glucose homeostasis.},

abstract = {Limited chemical diversity of nucleic acid libraries has long been suspected to be a major constraining factor in the overall success of SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment). Despite this constraint, SELEX has enjoyed considerable success over the past quarter of a century as a result of the enormous size of starting libraries and conformational richness of nucleic acids. With judicious introduction of functional groups absent in natural nucleic acids, the "diversity gap" between nucleic acid-based ligands and protein-based ligands can be substantially bridged, to generate a new class of ligands that represent the best of both worlds. We have explored the effect of various functional groups at the 5-position of uracil and found that hydrophobic aromatic side chains have the most profound influence on the success rate of SELEX and allow the identification of ligands with very low dissociation rate constants (named Slow Off-rate Modified Aptamers or SOMAmers). Such modified nucleotides create unique intramolecular motifs and make direct contacts with proteins. Importantly, SOMAmers engage their protein targets with surfaces that have significantly more hydrophobic character compared with conventional aptamers, thereby increasing the range of epitopes that are available for binding. These improvements have enabled us to build a collection of SOMAmers to over 3,000 human proteins encompassing major families such as growth factors, cytokines, enzymes, hormones, and receptors, with additional SOMAmers aimed at pathogen and rodent proteins. Such a large and growing collection of exquisite affinity reagents expands the scope of possible applications in diagnostics and therapeutics.},

Assuming causality, 41{\%} of uterine and 10{\%} or more of gallbladder, kidney, liver, and colon cancers could be attributable to excess weight. We estimated that a 1 kg/m(2) population-wide increase in BMI would result in 3790 additional annual UK patients developing one of the ten cancers positively associated with BMI.|BMI is associated with cancer risk, with substantial population-level effects.

abstract = {Despite a large volume of evidence supporting the use of dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with acute coronary syndrome, there remains major uncertainty regarding the optimal duration of therapy. Clinical trials have varied markedly in the duration of therapy, both across and within trials. Recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses suggest that shorter durations of dual antiplatelet therapy are superior because the avoidance of atherothrombotic events is counterbalanced by the greater risks of excess major bleeding with apparent increases in all-cause mortality with longer durations. These findings did not show significant heterogeneity according to whether patients had stable or unstable coronary heart disease. Moreover, the potential hazards and benefits may differ when applied to the general broad population of patients encountered in everyday clinical practice who have markedly higher bleeding and atherothrombotic event rates. Clinicians lack definitive information regarding the duration of therapy in patients with acute coronary syndrome and risk scores do not appear to be sufficiently robust to address these concerns. We believe that there is a pressing need to undertake a broad inclusive safety trial of shorter durations of therapy in real world populations of patients with acute coronary syndrome. The clinical evidence would further inform future research into strategies for personalised medicine.},

abstract = {Reticulated platelets (RPs) are young thrombocytes, newly released from the bone marrow. The identification and quantification of these cells remained difficult for decades due to a lack of standardized preanalytical and analytical methods. With the introduction of automated hematology analyzers in clinical routine, the determination of RPs, either as a total count or as a fraction, became more reliable, faster and more affordable. Currently, RPs are the focus of research in multiple clinical settings. In cardiovascular medicine, recent studies have focused on the relationship between RPs, coronary artery disease (CAD) and clinical outcomes, as well as the impact of RPs on the effects of antiplatelet therapy. Cohort studies showed increased levels of RPs in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or cardioembolic stroke. In patients with ACS, increased levels of RPs were also associated with an increased incidence of major ischemic cardiovascular events during follow‐up. Further studies showed an association of levels of RPs with the antiplatelet response to less‐potent P2Y12 inhibitors. In patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation undergoing pulmonary vein isolation, levels of RPs differed significantly depending on the achieved rhythm (sinus rhythm vs. recurrent atrial fibrillation). Levels of RPs appear to also be predictive for bleeding events in patients with various hematological diagnoses. Although no causal relationship has so far been proven, RP values have been associated with a large number of pathologies and clinical scenarios. This review summarizes the current evidence with regard to RPs and their potential diagnostic and prognostic value for noncardiovascular patients and for cardiovascular patients in particular. It describes further perspectives on how the testing of these cells might improve the treatment of cardiovascular patients.},

abstract = {Previous studies reported an association between elevated mean platelet volume (MPV) and post-myocardial infarction mortality. This study explores the association between long-term mortality after non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and the peripheral blood platelet indices (i.e., the mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet count, and the MPV/platelet (MPV/P) ratio). Two physicians independently reviewed the data of 619 NSTEMI patients. The blood samples were drawn and analyzed within 1 h of admission, the second, and the last hospital days. Patients were stratified into equal tertiles according to the platelet count, MPV, and MPV/platelet ratio. The primary outcome, 4-year all-cause mortality, was compared among the platelet indices tertile models. According to MPV, platelet count, and MPV/platelet ratio tertile models, there was a trend of higher 4-year mortality for the lower and upper tertiles in comparison to the middle tertiles. However, only the admission MPV/platelet ratio tercile model was statistically significant for predicting the 4-year mortality. The mortality rate of the highest MPV/platelet (48/207 (23{\%})) and the lowest (41/206 (20{\%})) tertiles were significantly higher than the middle tertile (19/206 (9{\%})), p = 0.0004 by the chi-squared test. After adjusting for Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events, the patients in the combined first and third MPV/P tertiles had higher mortality in reference to those in the middle MPV/P tercile (hazard ratio 1.951, confidence interval 1.032-3.687, and p {\textless} 0.0396). Our novel finding is that the MPV/platelet ratio is superior to the MPV alone in predicting long-term mortality after NSTEMI. We suggest that using this ratio will magnify any existing relationship between platelet indices and mortality post-NSTMI. Further studies are needed to confirm our finding.},

Recall-by-Genotype (RbG) is an approach that enables the collection of precise phenotypic measures in smaller studies, whilst maintaining statistical power and ability for causal inference.|In this study, we used a combination of conventional multivariable regression analysis, Mendelian randomization (MR) and sub-sample RbG methodologies to estimate the causal effect of BMI on gross-level and detailed cardiovascular health in healthy participants from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children at age 17 (N=1420-3108 for different outcomes) and an independent sample from the same cohort (for RbG) study at age 21 (N=386-418).|In both MR and RbG analyses, results suggested that higher BMI causes higher blood pressure (BP) and left ventricular mass index (LVMI) in young adults (e.g., difference in LVMI per kg/m|Complementary MR and RbG causal methodologies, together with a range of sensitivity analyses, suggest that higher BMI is likely to cause worse cardiovascular health, specifically higher BP and LVMI, even in youth. Higher BMI also resulted in increased CO in the RbG study, which appeared to be solely driven by SV, as neither MR nor RbG analyses suggested a causal effect of BMI on heart rate. These consistent results support efforts to reduce BMI from a young age to prevent later adverse cardiovascular health and illustrate the potential for phenotypic resolution with maintained analytical power using RbG.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with intermediate phenotypes, like changes in metabolite and protein levels, provide functional evidence to map disease associations and translate them into clinical applications. However, although hundreds of genetic variants have been associated with complex disorders, the underlying molecular pathways often remain elusive. Associations with intermediate traits are key in establishing functional links between GWAS-identified risk-variants and disease end points. Here we describe a GWAS using a highly multiplexed aptamer-based affinity proteomics platform. We quantify 539 associations between protein levels and gene variants (pQTLs) in a German cohort and replicate over half of them in an Arab and Asian cohort. Fifty-five of the replicated pQTLs are located in trans. Our associations overlap with 57 genetic risk loci for 42 unique disease end points. We integrate this information into a genome-proteome network and provide an interactive web-tool for interrogations. Our results provide a basis for novel approaches to pharmaceutical and diagnostic applications.},

abstract = {Dysfunctional lipid metabolism is a hallmark of obesity and insulin resistance and a risk factor for various cardiovascular and metabolic complications. In addition to the well known increase in plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids, recent work in humans and rodents has shown that obesity is associated with elevations in the bioactive class of sphingolipids known as ceramides. However, in obesity little is known about the plasma concentrations of sphinogsine-1-phosphate (S1P), the breakdown product of ceramide, which is an important signaling molecule in mammalian biology. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the impact of obesity on circulating S1P concentration and its relationship with markers of glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity.|Plasma S1P levels were determined in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced and genetically obese (ob/ob) mice along with obese humans. Circulating S1P was elevated in both obese mouse models and in obese humans compared with lean healthy controls. Furthermore, in humans, plasma S1P positively correlated with total body fat percentage, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, HbA1c ({\%}), total and LDL cholesterol. In addition, fasting increased plasma S1P levels in lean healthy mice.|We show that elevations in plasma S1P are a feature of both human and rodent obesity and correlate with metabolic abnormalities such as adiposity and insulin resistance.},

abstract = {Chondroadherin, a leucine rich repeat extracellular matrix protein with functions in cell to matrix interactions, binds cells via their $\alpha$2$\beta$1 integrin as well as via cell surface proteoglycans, providing for different sets of signals to the cell. Additionally, the protein acts as an anchor to the matrix by binding tightly to collagens type I and II as well as type VI. We generated mice with inactivated chondroadherin gene to provide integrated studies of the role of the protein. The null mice presented distinct phenotypes with affected cartilage as well as bone. At 3-6 weeks of age the epiphyseal growth plate was widened most pronounced in the proliferative zone. The proteome of the femoral head articular cartilage at 4 months of age showed some distinct differences, with increased deposition of cartilage intermediate layer protein 1 and fibronectin in the chondroadherin deficient mice, more pronounced in the female. Other proteins show decreased levels in the deficient mice, particularly pronounced for matrilin-1, thrombospondin-1 and notably the members of the $\alpha$1-antitrypsin family of proteinase inhibitors as well as for a member of the bone morphogenetic protein growth factor family. Thus, cartilage homeostasis is distinctly altered. The bone phenotype was expressed in several ways. The number of bone sialoprotein mRNA expressing cells in the proximal tibial metaphysic was decreased and the osteoid surface was increased possibly indicating a change in mineral metabolism. Micro-CT revealed lower cortical thickness and increased structure model index, i.e. the amount of plates and rods composing the bone trabeculas. The structural changes were paralleled by loss of function, where the null mice showed lower femoral neck failure load and tibial strength during mechanical testing at 4 months of age. The skeletal phenotype points at a role for chondroadherin in both bone and cartilage homeostasis, however, without leading to altered longitudinal growth. {\textcopyright} 2013 Hessle et al.},

To understand the genetic basis of obesity better, here we conduct a genome-wide association study and Metabochip meta-analysis of body mass index (BMI), a measure commonly used to define obesity and assess adiposity, in up to 339,224 individuals. This analysis identifies 97 BMI-associated loci (P {\textless} 5 × 10(-8)), 56 of which are novel. Five loci demonstrate clear evidence of several independent association signals, and many loci have significant effects on other metabolic phenotypes.

The new conception of obesity as a basal inflammatory condition has opened a new window of possibilities to identify inflammatory biomarkers to be used in the diagnosis or prognosis of obesity-associated comorbidities. This present work aims the identification of the adipokines (leptin and resistin), chemokines (CCL2, CCL5, CXCL16) and the BMP-2 and their association with the clinical, biochemical (fasting glucose, hemogram, cholesterol, T3, T4 and TSH) and anthropometric (weight, height, body circumferences, skinfold thickness and percentage of body fat) parameters in young adults (18-30 years old) presenting obesity and overweight. Our data showed increasing in anthropometric parameters and in the plasma inflammatory levels in those individuals presenting overweight and obesity. We observed a higher plasma levels of CCL2, CCL5, CXCL16, leptin and resistin in those overweigh and obese individuals. In addition, the CCL2, CCL5 presented a positive correlation with the body mass index and the body fat percentage. Assuming the obesity as a systemic inflammatory process, in this current study, the overweight individuals possess a close similar pattern of circulating inflammatory mediators which might be a potential risk of the development of obesity comorbidities. Further studies are still needed to precise the role of the biomarkers CCL2, CCL5, CXCL16 and BMP-2 in the clinical prognosis related to the overweight or obese individuals.},

abstract = {Over the past several decades, studies of the sympathetic nervous system in humans, sheep, rabbits, rats, and mice have substantially increased mechanistic understanding of cardiovascular function and dysfunction. Recently, interest in sympathetic neural mechanisms contributing to blood pressure control has grown, in part because of the development of devices or surgical procedures that treat hypertension by manipulating sympathetic outflow. Studies in animal models have provided important insights into physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms that are not accessible in human studies. Across species and among laboratories, various approaches have been developed to record, quantify, analyze, and interpret sympathetic nerve activity (SNA). In general, SNA demonstrates "bursting" behavior, where groups of action potentials are synchronized and linked to the cardiac cycle via the arterial baroreflex. In humans, it is common to quantify SNA as bursts per minute or bursts per 100 heart beats. This type of quantification can be done in other species but is only commonly reported in sheep, which have heart rates similar to humans. In rabbits, rats, and mice, SNA is often recorded relative to a maximal level elicited in the laboratory to control for differences in electrode position among animals or on different study days. SNA in humans can also be presented as total activity, where normalization to the largest burst is a common approach. The goal of the present paper is to put together a summary of "best practices" in several of the most common experimental models and to discuss opportunities and challenges relative to the optimal measurement of SNA across species.Listen to this article's corresponding podcast at https://ajpheart.podbean.com/e/guidelines-for-measuring-sympathetic-nerve-activity/.},

abstract = {Accumulating evidence indicates a key role of inflammation in hypertension and cardiovascular disorders. However, the role of inflammatory processes in neurogenic hypertension remains to be determined. Thus, our objective in the present study was to test the hypothesis that activation of microglial cells and the generation of proinflammatory cytokines in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) contribute to neurogenic hypertension. Intracerebroventricular infusion of minocycline, an anti-inflammatory antibiotic, caused a significant attenuation of mean arterial pressure, cardiac hypertrophy, and plasma norepinephrine induced by chronic angiotensin II infusion. This was associated with decreases in the numbers of activated microglia and mRNAs for interleukin (IL) 1beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and an increase in the mRNA for IL-10 in the PVN. Overexpression of IL-10 induced by recombinant adenoassociated virus-mediated gene transfer in the PVN mimicked the antihypertensive effects of minocycline. Furthermore, acute application of a proinflammatory cytokine, IL-1beta, into the left ventricle or the PVN in normal rats resulted in a significant increase in mean arterial pressure. Collectively, this indicates that angiotensin II induced hypertension involves activation of microglia and increases in proinflammatory cytokines in the PVN. These data have significant implications on the development of innovative therapeutic strategies for the control of neurogenic hypertension.},

abstract = {Minocycline, a semisynthetic tetracycline derivative, protects brain against global and focal ischemia in rodents. We examined whether minocycline reduces excitotoxicity in primary neuronal cultures. Minocycline (0.02 microm) significantly increased neuronal survival in mixed spinal cord (SC) cultures treated with 500 microm glutamate or 100 microm kainate for 24 hr. Treatment with these excitotoxins induced a dose-dependent proliferation of microglia that was associated with increased release of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and was followed by increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. The excitotoxicity was enhanced when microglial cells were cultured on top of SC cultures. Minocycline prevented excitotoxin-induced microglial proliferation and the increased release of nitric oxide (NO) metabolites and IL-1beta. Excitotoxins induced microglial proliferation and increased the release of NO metabolites and IL-1beta also in pure microglia cultures, and these responses were inhibited by minocycline. In both SC and pure microglia cultures, excitotoxins activated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) exclusively in microglia. Minocycline inhibited p38 MAPK activation in SC cultures, and treatment with SB203580, a p38 MAPK inhibitor, but not with PD98059, a p44/42 MAPK inhibitor, increased neuronal survival. In pure microglia cultures, glutamate induced transient activation of p38 MAPK, and this was inhibited by minocycline. These findings indicate that the proliferation and activation of microglia contributes to excitotoxicity, which is inhibited by minocycline, an antibiotic used in severe human infections.},

abstract = {Comprehensive, high throughput analysis of the plasma proteome has the potential to enable holistic analysis of the health state of an individual. Based on our own experience and the evaluation of recent large-scale plasma mass spectrometry (MS) based proteomic studies, we identified two outstanding challenges: slow and delicate nano-flow liquid chromatography (LC) and irreproducibility of identification of data-dependent acquisition (DDA). We determined an optimal solution reducing these limitations with robust capillary-flow data-independent acquisition (DIA) MS. This platform can measure 31 plasma proteomes per day. Using this setup, we acquired a large-scale plasma study of the diet, obesity and genes dietary (DiOGenes) comprising 1508 samples. Proving the robustness, the complete acquisition was achieved on a single analytical column. Totally, 565 proteins (459 identified with two or more peptide sequences) were profiled with 74{\%} data set completeness. On average 408 proteins (5246 peptides) were identified per acquisition (319 proteins in 90{\%} of all acquisitions). The workflow reproducibility was assessed using 34 quality control pools acquired at regular intervals, resulting in 92{\%} data set completeness with CVs for protein measurements of 10.9{\%}. The profiles of 20 apolipoproteins could be profiled revealing distinct changes. The weight loss and weight maintenance resulted in sustained effects on low-grade inflammation, as well as steroid hormone and lipid metabolism, indicating beneficial effects. Comparison to other large-scale plasma weight loss studies demonstrated high robustness and quality of biomarker candidates identified. Tracking of nonenzymatic glycation indicated a delayed, slight reduction of glycation in the weight maintenance phase. Using stable-isotope-references, we could directly and absolutely quantify 60 proteins in the DIA. In conclusion, we present herein the first large-scale plasma DIA study and one of the largest clinical research
proteomic studies to date. Application of this fast and robust workflow has great potential to advance biomarker discovery in plasma.},

abstract = {Since the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) is a pivotal region for regulating the set-point of arterial pressure, we proposed a role for it in the development of neurogenic hypertension. Recent studies have suggested that pro-inflammatory molecules are highly expressed in the NTS of an animal model of human essential hypertension--the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR), compared to normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rat (WKY). Based on this evidence, we hypothesized that inflammatory mediators such as cytokines are up-regulated in the hypertensive NTS. In the present study, we have assessed the level of gene expression of some cytokines in the NTS of SHR compared to WKY. In addition, for further confirmation of abnormal inflammatory condition within the NTS of SHR, we identified gene expression levels of an inflammatory marker, glycoprotein-39 (gp39) precursor, which is homologous to chitinase 3-like protein 1, human cartilage-gp39 or YKL40. The NTS was micro-dissected from 15-week-old male SHR and WKY rats. Total RNA was extracted and quantitative RT-PCR was performed. Gene expression of gp39 precursor and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 were higher in the NTS of SHR while inter-leukin-6 was lower in the NTS of SHR compared to the WKY. In contrast, there were no significant differences in the expression of other cytokines including: inter-leukin-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and transforming growth factor beta 1. These data together with our previous published finding of an over expression of junctional adhesion molecule-1 suggest that the NTS of the SHR exhibits a specific inflammatory state.},

abstract = {Background In high-income countries, obesity prevalence (body mass index greater than or equal to 30 kg/m2) is highest among the poor, while overweight (body mass index greater than or equal to 25 kg/m2) is prevalent across all wealth groups. In contrast, in low-income countries, the prevalence of overweight and obesity is higher among wealthier individuals than among poorer individuals. We characterize the transition of overweight and obesity from wealthier to poorer populations as countries develop, and project the burden of overweight and obesity among the poor for 103 countries. Methods and findings Our sample used 182 Demographic and Health Surveys and World Health Surveys (n = 2.24 million respondents) from 1995 to 2016. We created a standard wealth index using household assets common among all surveys and linked national wealth by country and year identifiers. We then estimated the changing probability of overweight and obesity across every wealth decile as countries' per capita gross domestic product (GDP) rises using logistic and linear fixed-effect regression models. We found that obesity rates among the wealthiest decile were relatively stable with increasing national wealth, and the changing gradient was largely due to increasing obesity prevalence among poorer populations (3.5{\%} [95{\%} uncertainty interval: 0.0{\%}-8.3{\%}] to 14.3{\%} [9.7{\%}-19.0{\%}]). Overweight prevalence among the richest (45.0{\%} [35.6{\%}-54.4{\%}]) and the poorest (45.5{\%} [35.9{\%}-55.0{\%}]) were roughly equal in high-income settings. At {\$}8,000 GDP per capita, the adjusted probability of being obese was no longer highest in the richest decile, and the same was true of overweight at {\$}10,000. Above {\$}25,000, individuals in the richest decile were less likely than those in the poorest decile to be obese, and the same was true of overweight at {\$}50,000. We then projected overweight and obesity rates by wealth decile to 2040 for all countries to quantify the expected rise in prevalence in the relatively poor. Our projections indicated that, if past trends continued, the number of people who are poor and overweight will increase in our study countries by a median 84.4{\%} (range 3.54{\%}-383.4{\%}), most prominently in lowincome countries. The main limitations of this study included the inclusion of cross-sectional, self-reported data, possible reverse causality of overweight and obesity on wealth, and the lack of physical activity and food price data. Conclusions Our findings indicate that as countries develop economically, overweight prevalence increased substantially among the poorest and stayed mostly unchanged among the wealthiest. The relative poor in upper- and lower-middle income countries may have the greatest burden, indicating important planning and targeting needs for national health programs.},

These present new opportunities to identify molecular pathways involved in disease pathogenesis. We performed association analysis between PRSs and 3,442 plasma proteins in 3,175 healthy individuals, identifying 48 proteins whose levels associated with PRSs for coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, or type 2 diabetes. Integrative analyses of human and mouse data to characterise these associations revealed a role for polygenic effects on several well-known causal disease proteins and identified promising novel targets for future follow-up. We found implicated PRS-associated genes were responsive to dietary intervention in mice and showed strong evidence of druggability in humans, consistent with PRS-associated proteins having therapeutic potential. Overall, our study provides a framework for polygenic association studies, demonstrating the power of PRSs to unravel novel disease biology.},

Emerging data suggest that echocardiographically determined left ventricular hypertrophy is independently associated with risk of ischemic stroke.The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the frequency of different patterns of left ventricular (LV) remodeling and hypertrophy in a group of consecutive patients admitted with non-cardioembolic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). In particular, we were interested in how often the relative wall thickness (RWT) was abnormal in patients with normal LV mass index (LVMI). As both abnormal RWT and LVMI indicate altered LV remodeling, the secondary objective of this research was to study whether a significant number of patients would be missing the diagnosis of LV remodeling if the RWT is not measured.All patients were referred within 48 hours after a stroke or a TIA for a clinically indicated transthoracic echocardiogram. The echocardiographic findings of consecutive patients with non-cardioembolic stroke or TIA were analyzed.All necessary measurements were performed in 368 patients, who were enrolled in the study. Mean age was 63.7 ± 12.5 years, 64.4{\%} men. Concentric remodeling carried the highest frequency, 49.2{\%}, followed by concentric hypertrophy, 30.7{\%}, normal pattern, 15.5{\%}, and eccentric hypertrophy, 4.1{\%}. The frequency of abnormal left ventricular RWT (80.4{\%}) was significantly higher than that of abnormal LVMI (35.3{\%}), (McNemar P {\textless} 0.05).In this group of non-cardioembolic stroke patients, abnormal LV remodeling as assessed by relative wall thickness is very frequent. As RWT was often found without increased LV mass, the abnormal left ventricular geometry may be missed if RWT is not measured or reported.},

We validated a subset of the observed associations in an independent case-control study of type 2 diabetes. These protein associations provide novel biological insights into the molecular mechanisms that are dysregulated prior to and following the onset of type 2 diabetes and can be detected in serum.

Referents were matched for sex, age, date and type of health survey, and geographical region. Blood pressure, body mass index (BMI) and the presence of smoking, diabetes and hypertension were recorded. Total cholesterol, apolipoprotein A-1 (apo A-1), apolipoprotein B (apo B), plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1), insulin, and leptin were analysed in stored samples. Their influences on first-ever AMI were analysed by conditional logistic regression analysis.|Men with first-ever AMI had higher BMI, plasma insulin and leptin, and diastolic blood pressure than the referents. Furthermore, they had lower plasma apo A-1 and were more often smokers. Smoking, high leptin, PAI-1 and cholesterol, and low apo A-1 levels were significant risk factors for first-ever AMI in univariate analysis. High leptin (OR 8.97; 95{\%} CI: 1.73-46.5) and cholesterol (OR 5.18; 95{\%} CI: 1.34-20.0) levels remained significant risk factors for AMI in a multivariate model.

abstract = {We have recently identified several adipokines as oversecreted by omental adipose tissue (AT) of obese subjects: two chemokines (growth-related oncogene factor-alpha (GRO-alpha), macrophage inflammatory protein-1 beta (MIP-1 beta)), a tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1), an interleukin-7 (IL-7) and a megakaryocytic growth-factor (thrombopoietin (TPO)). These adipokines are involved in insulin resistance and atherosclerosis. The objectives of this study were to determine whether the circulating levels of these adipokines were increased in obesity and to identify the responsible factors. A cross-sectional study including 32 lean (BMI (kg/m(2)) {\textless}25), 15 overweight (BMI: 25-29.9), 11 obese (BMI: 30-39.9), and 17 severely obese (BMI {\textgreater}40) age-matched women was carried out. Serum adipokine levels, insulin sensitivity, and substrate oxidation were measured by ELISA, euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp, and indirect calorimetry, respectively. Circulating levels of GRO-alpha, TPO, and TIMP-1 were higher in obese and/or severely obese women than in lean ones (+30, 55, and 20{\%}, respectively). Serum levels of these adipokines positively correlated with insulinemia or glycemia, and negatively with insulin sensitivity. TIMP-1 also positively correlated with blood pressure, and TPO with triglyceride levels. Multiple regression analysis showed that fat mass per se was an independent determinant of GRO-alpha, TPO, and TIMP-1 levels, suggesting that hypertrophied adipocytes and recruited macrophages in expanded AT mainly contribute to this hyperadipokinemia. Insulinemia, glycemia and resistance of glucose oxidation to insulin were additional predictors for TPO. Circulating GRO-alpha, TPO, and TIMP-1 levels are increased in obesity. This may be partially due to augmented adiposity per se and to hyperinsulinemia/insulin resistance. These high systemic levels may in turn worsen/promote insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease.},

We used a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate trends from 1975 to 2015 in mean systolic and mean diastolic blood pressure, and the prevalence of raised blood pressure for 200 countries. We calculated the contributions of changes in prevalence versus population growth and ageing to the increase in the number of adults with raised blood pressure.|We pooled 1479 studies that had measured the blood pressures of 19{\textperiodcentered}1 million adults. Global age-standardised mean systolic blood pressure in 2015 was 127{\textperiodcentered}0 mm Hg (95{\%} credible interval 125{\textperiodcentered}7-128{\textperiodcentered}3) in men and 122{\textperiodcentered}3 mm Hg (121{\textperiodcentered}0-123{\textperiodcentered}6) in women; age-standardised mean diastolic blood pressure was 78{\textperiodcentered}7 mm Hg (77{\textperiodcentered}9-79{\textperiodcentered}5) for men and 76{\textperiodcentered}7 mm Hg (75{\textperiodcentered}9-77{\textperiodcentered}6) for women. Global age-standardised prevalence of raised blood pressure was 24{\textperiodcentered}1{\%} (21{\textperiodcentered}4-27{\textperiodcentered}1) in men and 20{\textperiodcentered}1{\%} (17{\textperiodcentered}8-22{\textperiodcentered}5) in women in 2015. Mean systolic and mean diastolic blood pressure decreased substantially from 1975 to 2015 in high-income western and Asia Pacific countries, moving these countries from having some of the highest worldwide blood pressure in 1975 to the lowest in 2015. Mean blood pressure also decreased in women in central and eastern Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, and, more recently, central Asia, Middle East, and north Africa, but the estimated trends in these super-regions had larger uncertainty than in high-income super-regions. By contrast, mean blood pressure might have increased in east and southeast Asia, south Asia, Oceania, and sub-Saharan Africa. In 2015, central and eastern Europe, sub-Saharan Africa, and south Asia had the highest blood pressure levels. Prevalence of raised blood pressure decreased in high-income and some middle-income countries; it remained unchanged elsewhere. The number of adults with raised blood pressure increased from 594 million in 1975 to 1{\textperiodcentered}13 billion in 2015, with the increase largely in low-income and middle-income countries. The global increase in the number of adults with raised blood pressure is a net effect of increase due to population growth and ageing, and decrease due to declining age-specific prevalence.|During the past four decades, the highest worldwide blood pressure levels have shifted from high-income countries to low-income countries in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa due to opposite trends, while blood pressure has been persistently high in central and eastern Europe.|Wellcome Trust.},

abstract = {Background: Variation in adiposity is associated with cardiometabolic disease outcomes, but the mechanisms leading from this exposure to disease are unclear. This study aimed to estimate effects of adiposity, proxied by body mass index (BMI), on an extensive set of circulating proteins using both observational and genetically informed analyses. Methods and findings: We used proteomic data from up to 2,737 healthy participants from the INTERVAL study of UK blood donors. Associations between self-reported BMI and 3,622 unique plasma proteins measured by the SomaLogic platform were explored using linear regression. These were complemented by Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses using a genetic risk score (GRS) comprised of 654 BMI-associated polymorphisms from a recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) of adult BMI. Observationally, BMI showed associations with 1,576 protein traits (Bonferroni corrected P {\textless} 1.4 x 10-5), with strong associations with leptin, fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4) and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG). The GRS for BMI was positively associated with self-reported BMI to the extent expected given its known genetic association (R2 = 0.028) and there was a lack of strong association between this GRS and measured confounding factors. MR analyses provided further evidence for a causal relationship between BMI and a range of measured proteins (eight in this analysis achieved P {\textless}1.4x10-5) including a strong relationship with leptin levels (0.63 standard deviation (SD) per SD BMI, 95{\%} CI 0.48 to 0.79, P = 1.6x10-15), FABP4 (0.64 SD per SD BMI, 95{\%} CI 0.46 to 0.83, P = 6.7x10-12) and SHBG abundance (-0.45 SD per SD BMI, 95{\%} CI -0.65 to -0.25, P = 1.4x10-5). There was strong agreement in the direction and magnitude of observational and MR estimates (R2 = 0.33) and evidence that proteins most strongly altered by BMI were enriched for genes involved in cardiovascular disease (1.14 fold enrichment, P = 1.3 x 10-4). Limitations of this particular set of analyses include a modest sample size and a derivation of measured BMI from self-reported height and weight. Conclusions: This study provides evidence for a broad impact of adiposity on the human proteome. Proteins most strongly altered by BMI include those which are involved in regulating appetite, sex hormones, and inflammation; such proteins are also enriched for genes related to cardiovascular disease. These results help to focus attention onto new potential targets for obesity-related disease prevention.Competing Interest StatementJohn Danesh sits on the International Cardiovascular and Metabolic Advisory Board for Novartis (since 2010); the Steering Committee of UK Biobank (since 2011); the MRC International Advisory Group (ING) member, London (since 2013); the MRC High Throughput Science Omics Panel Member, London (since 2013); the Scientific Advisory Committee for Sanofi (since 2013); the International Cardiovascular and Metabolism Research and Development Portfolio Committee for Novartis; and the Astra Zeneca Genomics Advisory Board (2018).Funding StatementFunding: This publication is the work of the authors who are guarantors for its contents.

Immature (reticulated) platelets may modulate the antiplatelet effects of clopidogrel but must be measured using flow cytometry. Whether new automated detection techniques yield similar results is not known. The objectives of the study to evaluate the role of immature platelets assessed by an automated method in response to the anti-platelet effects of clopidogrel. Twenty-nine healthy volunteers had platelet studies performed before and 1 week after 75 mg daily dosing of clopidogrel. Immature platelet fraction (IPF) was determined using an automated particle counter. Subjects were stratified into tertiles based on the IPF. Platelet studies included light transmission aggregometry (LTA), and vasodilator stimulated phosphoprotein phosphorylation (VASP-P) determined by platelet reactivity index (PRI). Baseline platelet aggregation responses to 2, 5 and 20 lM ADP, were similar in all three tertiles, however they were greater in the upper than in the lower tertile of immature platelets after clopidogrel in response to 5 lM ADP (54{\%} vs. 23{\%}, P = 0.02), with concordant trends for the other two concentrations. PRI was also greater in the upper tertile after clopidogrel (71.2{\%} vs. 57.8{\%}, P = 0.04). The frequency of clopidogrel hyporesponsiveness (aggregation[50{\%} in response to 5 lM of ADP) was also higher in the upper tertile when compared to lower tertile, (60{\%}) versus (10{\%}) respectively (P = 0.0001). Immature platelets measured using an automated method, are associated with impaired response to antiplatelet effects of clopidogrel. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.},

Here, we assessed the effectiveness of clopidogrel on platelet function inhibition in subjects with and without type-2 diabetes and stable coronary artery disease. In addition, we investigated the correlation between platelet function and routine clinical parameters.|A total of 64 patients with stable coronary heart disease were enrolled in the study. Among these, 32 had known type-2 diabetes, whereas the remaining 32 subjects were non-diabetics (control group). A loading dose of 300 mg clopidogrel was given to clopidogrel-na{\"{i}}ve patients (13 patients in the diabetes group and 14 control patients). All patients were given a daily maintenance dose of 75 mg clopidogrel. In addition, all patients received 100 mg ASA per day. Agonist-induced platelet aggregation measurements were performed on hirudin-anticoagulated blood using an impedance aggregometer (Multiple Platelet Function Analyzer, Dynabyte, Munich, Germany). Blood samples were drawn from the antecubital vein 24 h after coronary angiography with percutaneous coronary intervention. The platelets were then stimulated with ADP alone or ADP and prostaglandin-E (ADP and ADP-PGE tests, respectively) in order to evaluate clopidogrel-mediated inhibition of platelet function. The effectiveness of ASA was measured by stimulation with arachidonic acid (ASPI test). In addition, maximal platelet aggregation was assessed via stimulation with thrombin receptor-activating peptide (TRAP test).|Patients with diabetes exhibited significantly less inhibition of platelet function than patients without diabetes (ADP-PGE test p = 0.003; ASPI test p = 0.022). Administering a clopidogrel loading dose of 300 mg did not result in a lower level of ADP-PGE-induced platelet reactivity in comparison to the use of a 75 mg maintenance dose. Moreover, we observed that ADP-PGE-induced platelet inhibition was positively correlated with fasting blood glucose and HbA1c (p {\textless} 0.01).|Patients with type-2 diabetes exhibited increased platelet reactivity compared to patients without diabetes despite combined treatment with clopidogrel and ASA. Using a loading dose of clopidogrel rather than small daily doses was not sufficient for adequately overcoming increased platelet reactivity in patients with type-2 diabetes, highlighting the need for more effective anti-platelet drugs for such patients.},

abstract = {Sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) is a glycoprotein composed of two 373-amino-acid subunits. The SHBG gene and a promotor region have been identified. The SHBG receptor has yet to be cloned but is known to act through a G-protein-linked second-messenger system following plasma membrane binding. The principal function of SHBG has traditionally been considered to be that of a transport protein for sex steroids, regulating circulating concentrations of free (unbound) hormones and their transport to target tissues. Recent research suggests that SHBG has functions in addition to the binding and transport of sex steroids. Observational studies have associated a low SHBG concentration with an increased incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) independent of sex hormone levels in men and women. Genetic studies using Mendelian randomization analysis linking three single nucleotide polymorphisms of the SHBG gene to risk of developing type 2 DM suggest SHBG may have a role in the pathogenesis of type 2 DM. The correlation between SHBG and insulin resistance that is evident in a number of cross-sectional studies is in keeping with the suggestion that the association between SHBG and incidence of type 2 DM is explained by insulin resistance. Several potential mechanisms may account for this association, including the identification of dietary factors that influence SHBG gene transcription. Further research to characterize the SHBG-receptor and the SHBG second messenger system is required. An interventional study examining the effects on insulin resistance of altering SHBG concentrations may help in determining whether this association is causal.},

abstract = {Hemostasis encompasses a set of tightly regulated processes that govern blood clotting, platelet activation, and vascular repair. Upon vascular injury, the hemostatic system initiates a series of vascular events and activates extravascular receptors that act in concert to seal off the damage. Blood clotting is subsequently attenuated by a plethora of inhibitors that prevent excessive clot formation and eventual thrombosis. The endothelium which resides at the interface between the blood and surrounding tissues, serves an integral role in the hemostatic system. Depending on specific tissue needs and local stresses, endothelial cells are capable of evoking either antithrombotic or prothrombotic events. Healthy endothelial cells express antiplatelet and anticoagulant agents that prevent platelet aggregation and fibrin formation, respectively. In the face of endothelial dysfunction, endothelial cells trigger fibrin formation, as well as platelet adhesion and aggregation. Finally, endothelial cells release pro-fibrinolytic agents that initiate fibrinolysis to degrade the clot. Taken together, a functional endothelium is essential to maintain hemostasis and prevent thrombosis. Thus, a greater understanding into the role of the endothelium can provide new avenues for exploration and novel therapies for the management of thromboembolisms.},

The magnitude of these abnormalities relates to disease progression and mortality. Less clear is the origin of these derangements and the sequence of triggering mechanisms in the course of the natural history of CHF. To date, immune activation and autonomic imbalance have been considered independently; we hypothesise they are closely related. Damaged heart muscle through autonomic afferents triggers functional and structural changes in the central nervous system, in part related to inflammatory processes. The altered function of the autonomic centres is expressed as a reduction of central parasympathetic tone. Diminished cholinergic signalling (mainly nicotinergic) activates inflammation and stimulates immune response. These two phenomena predict prognosis and represent therapeutic targets in the syndrome of CHF.},

abstract = {Hypertension is a common disorder with uncertain etiology. In the last several years, it has become evident that components of both the innate and adaptive immune system play an essential role in hypertension. Macrophages and T cells accumulate in the perivascular fat, the heart and the kidney of hypertensive patients, and in animals with experimental hypertension. Various immunosuppressive agents lower blood pressure and prevent end-organ damage. Mice lacking lymphocytes are protected against hypertension, and adoptive transfer of T cells, but not B cells in the animals restores their blood pressure response to stimuli such as angiotensin II or high salt. Recent studies have shown that mice lacking macrophages have blunted hypertension in response to angiotensin II and that genetic deletion of macrophages markedly reduces experimental hypertension. Dendritic cells have also been implicated in this disease. Many hypertensive stimuli have triggering effects on the central nervous system and signals arising from the circumventricular organ seem to promote inflammation. Studies have suggested that central signals activate macrophages and T cells, which home to the kidney and vasculature and release cytokines, including IL-6 and IL-17, which in turn cause renal and vascular dysfunction and lead to blood pressure elevation. These recent discoveries provide a new understanding of hypertension and provide novel therapeutic opportunities for treatment of this serious disease.},

abstract = {Activation of GPIIb/IIIa is known to require agonist-induced inside-out signaling through G(q), G(i), and G(z). Although activated by several platelet agonists, including thrombin and thromboxane A(2), the contribution of the G(12/13) signaling pathway to GPIIb/IIIa activation has not been investigated. In this study, we used selective stimulation of G protein pathways to investigate the contribution of G(12/13) activation to platelet fibrinogen receptor activation. YFLLRNP is a PAR-1-specific partial agonist that, at low concentrations (60 microm), selectively activates the G(12/13) signaling cascade resulting in platelet shape change without stimulating the G(q) or G(i) signaling pathways. YFLLRNP-mediated shape change was completely inhibited by the p160(ROCK) inhibitor, Y-27632. At this low concentration, YFLLRNP-mediated G(12/13) signaling caused platelet aggregation and enhanced PAC-1 binding when combined with selective G(i) or G(z) signaling, via selective stimulation of the P2Y(12) receptor or alpha(2A)-adrenergic receptor, respectively. Similar data were obtained when using low dose (10 nm), a thromboxane A(2) mimetic, to activate G(12/13) in the presence of G(i) signaling. These results suggest that selective activation of G(12/13) causes platelet GPIIb/IIIa activation when combined with G(i) signaling. Unlike either G(12/13) or G(i) activation alone, co-activation of both G(12/13) and G(i) resulted in a small increase in intracellular calcium. Chelation of intracellular calcium with dimethyl BAPTA dramatically blocked G(12/13) and G(i)-mediated platelet aggregation. No significant effect on aggregation was seen when using selective inhibitors for p160(ROCK), PKC, or MEKK1. PI 3-kinase inhibition lead to near abolishment of platelet aggregation induced by co-stimulation of G(q) and G(i) pathways, but not by G(12/13) and G(i) pathways. These data demonstrate that co-stimulation of G(12/13) and G(i) pathways is sufficient to activate GPIIb/IIIa in human platelets in a mechanism that involves intracellular calcium, and that PI 3-kinase is an important signaling molecule downstream of G(q) but not downstream of G(12/13) pathway.},

abstract = {Minocycline is a second-generation, semi-synthetic tetracycline that has been in therapeutic use for over 30 years because of its antibiotic properties against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. It is mainly used in the treatment of acne vulgaris and some sexually transmitted diseases. Recently, it has been reported that tetracyclines can exert a variety of biological actions that are independent of their anti-microbial activity, including anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic activities, and inhibition of proteolysis, angiogenesis and tumour metastasis. These findings specifically concern to minocycline as it has recently been found to have multiple non-antibiotic biological effects that are beneficial in experimental models of various diseases with an inflammatory basis, including dermatitis, periodontitis, atherosclerosis and autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. Of note, minocycline has also emerged as the most effective tetracycline derivative at providing neuroprotection. This effect has been confirmed in experimental models of ischaemia, traumatic brain injury and neuropathic pain, and of several neurodegenerative conditions including Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injury. Moreover, other pre-clinical studies have shown its ability to inhibit malignant cell growth and activation and replication of human immunodeficiency virus, and to prevent bone resorption. Considering the above-mentioned findings, this review will cover the most important topics in the pharmacology of minocycline to date, supporting its evaluation as a new therapeutic approach for many of the diseases described herein.},

In the hypertensive group, LV mass index correlated with nighttime (8:00 PM to 6:00 AM) systolic (r = 0.51) and diastolic (r = 0.35) blood pressure more closely than with daytime (6:00 AM to 8:00 PM) systolic (r = 0.38) and diastolic (r = 0.20) BP, or with casual systolic (r = 0.33) and diastolic (r = 0.27) BP. Hypertensive patients were divided into two groups by presence (group 1) and absence (group 2) of a reduction of both systolic and diastolic BP during the night by an average of more than 10{\%} of the daytime pressure. Casual BP, ambulatory daytime systolic and diastolic BP, sex, body surface area, duration of hypertension, prevalence of diabetes, quantity of sleep during monitoring, funduscopic changes, and serum creatinine did not differ between the two groups.

Aim was to investigate whether subpopulations of platelets were programmed to procoagulant and inflammatory activities in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with pneumonia, without comorbidities predisposing to thromboembolism. Approach and Results: Overall, 37 patients and 28 healthy subjects were studied. Platelet-leukocyte aggregates, platelet-derived microvesicles, the expression of P-selectin, and active fibrinogen receptor on platelets were quantified by flow cytometry. The profile of 45 cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors released by platelets was defined by immunoassay. The contribution of platelets to coagulation factor activity was selectively measured. Numerous platelet-monocyte (mean±SE, 67.9±4.9{\%}, n=17 versus 19.4±3.0{\%}, n=22; P{\textless}0.0001) and platelet-granulocyte conjugates (34.2±4.04{\%} versus 8.6±0.7{\%}; P{\textless}0.0001) were detected in patients. Resting patient platelets had similar levels of P-selectin (10.9±2.6{\%}, n=12) to collagen-activated control platelets (8.7±1.5{\%}), which was not further increased by collagen activation on patient platelets (12.4±2.5{\%}, P=nonsignificant). The agonist-stimulated expression of the active fibrinogen receptor was reduced by 60{\%} in patients (P{\textless}0.0001 versus controls). Cytokines (IL [interleukin]-1$\alpha$, IL-1$\beta$, IL-1RA, IL-4, IL-10, IL-13, IL, 17, IL-27, IFN [interferon]-$\alpha$, and IFN-$\gamma$), chemokines (MCP-1/CCL2 [monocyte chemoattractant protein 1]), and growth factors (VEGF [vascular endothelial growth factor]-A/D) were released in significantly larger amounts upon stimulation of COVID-19 platelets. Platelets contributed to increased fibrinogen, VWF (von Willebrand factor), and factor XII in COVID-19 patients. Patients (28.5±0.7 s, n=32), unlike controls (31.6±0.5 s, n=28; P{\textless}0.001), showed accelerated factor XII-dependent coagulation.

Unchecked neurohumoral excitation is a critical element in the progressive clinical deterioration associated with the heart failure syndrome, and its peripheral manifestations have become the principal targets for intervention. The link between peripheral systems activated in heart failure and the central nervous system as a source of neurohumoral drive has therefore come under close scrutiny. In this context, the forebrain and particularly the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus have emerged as sites that sense humoral signals generated peripherally in response to the stresses of heart failure and contribute to the altered volume regulation and augmented sympathetic drive that characterize the heart failure syndrome. This brief review summarizes recent studies from our laboratory supporting the concept that the forebrain plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of ischemia-induced heart failure and suggesting that the forebrain contribution must be considered in designing therapeutic strategies. Forebrain signaling by neuroactive products of the renin-angiotensin system and the immune system are emphasized.},

abstract = {Increased adiposity is linked with higher risk for cardiometabolic diseases. We aimed to determine to what extent elevated body mass index (BMI) within the normal weight range has causal effects on the detailed systemic metabolite profile in early adulthood.|We used Mendelian randomization to estimate causal effects of BMI on 82 metabolic measures in 12,664 adolescents and young adults from four population-based cohorts in Finland (mean age 26 y, range 16-39 y; 51{\%} women; mean ± standard deviation BMI 24 ± 4 kg/m(2)). Circulating metabolites were quantified by high-throughput nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics and biochemical assays. In cross-sectional analyses, elevated BMI was adversely associated with cardiometabolic risk markers throughout the systemic metabolite profile, including lipoprotein subclasses, fatty acid composition, amino acids, inflammatory markers, and various hormones (p{\textless}0.0005 for 68 measures). Metabolite associations with BMI were generally stronger for men than for women (median 136{\%}, interquartile range 125{\%}-183{\%}). A gene score for predisposition to elevated BMI, composed of 32 established genetic correlates, was used as the instrument to assess causality. Causal effects of elevated BMI closely matched observational estimates (correspondence 87{\%} ± 3{\%}; R(2)= 0.89), suggesting causative influences of adiposity on the levels of numerous metabolites (p{\textless}0.0005 for 24 measures), including lipoprotein lipid subclasses and particle size, branched-chain and aromatic amino acids, and inflammation-related glycoprotein acetyls. Causal analyses of certain metabolites and potential sex differences warrant stronger statistical power. Metabolite changes associated with change in BMI during 6 y of follow-up were examined for 1,488 individuals. Change in BMI was accompanied by widespread metabolite changes, which had an association pattern similar to that of the cross-sectional observations, yet with greater metabolic effects (correspondence 160{\%} ± 2{\%}; R(2) = 0.92).|Mendelian randomization indicates causal adverse effects of increased adiposity with multiple cardiometabolic risk markers across the metabolite profile in adolescents and young adults within the non-obese weight range.

abstract = {The analysis of plasma kinetics of the sympathetic neurotransmitter norepinephrine can be used to estimate sympathetic nervous "activity" (integrated nerve firing rate) for the body as a whole and for individual organs. In 12 patients with cardiac failure (left ventricular ejection fraction 10{\%} to 39{\%}), the mean arterial plasma norepinephrine concentration was 557 +/- 68 pg/ml (mean +/- SE) compared with 211 +/- 21 pg/ml in 15 subjects without heart failure (p less than .002). The difference was due to both increased release of norepinephrine to plasma (indicating increased "total" sympathetic activity) and reduced clearance of norepinephrine from plasma. The increase in sympathetic activity did not involve all organs equally. Cardiac (32 +/- 9 vs 5 +/- 1 ng/min; p less than .002) and renal (202 +/- 45 vs 66 +/- 9 ng/min; p = .002) norepinephrine spillover were increased by 540{\%} and 206{\%}, respectively, but norepinephrine spillover from the lungs was normal. Adrenomedullary activity was also increased in the patients with heart failure, whose mean arterial plasma epinephrine concentration was 181 +/- 38 pg/ml compared with 71 +/- 12 pg/ml in control subjects (p less than .02). There is marked regional variation, inapparent from measurements of plasma norepinephrine concentration, in sympathetic nerve activity in patients with congestive heart failure. The finding of increased cardiorenal norepinephrine spillover has important pathophysiologic and therapeutic implications.},

abstract = {Recent work using single-unit sympathetic nerve recording techniques has demonstrated aberrations in the firing pattern of sympathetic nerves in a variety of patient groups. We sought to examine whether nerve firing pattern is associated with increased noradrenaline release. Using single-unit muscle sympathetic nerve recording techniques coupled with direct cardiac catheterisation and noradrenaline isotope dilution methodology we examined the relationship between single-unit firing patterns and cardiac and whole body noradrenaline spillover to plasma. Participants comprised patients with hypertension (n=6), depression (n=7) and panic disorder (n =9) who were drawn from our ongoing studies. The patient groups examined did not differ in their single-unit muscle sympathetic nerve firing characteristics nor in the rate of spillover of noradrenaline to plasma from the heart. The median incidence of multiple spikes per beat was 9{\%}. Patients were stratified according to the firing pattern: low level of incidence (less than 9{\%} incidence of multiple spikes per beat) and high level of incidence (greater than 9{\%} incidence of multiple spikes per beat). High incidence of multiple spikes within a cardiac cycle was associated with higher firing rates (P {\textless}0.0001) and increased probability of firing (P {\textless}0.0001). Whole body noradrenaline spillover to plasma and (multi-unit) muscle sympathetic nerve activity in subjects with low incidence of multiple spikes was not different to that of those with high incidence of multiple spikes. In those with high incidence of multiple spikes there occurred a parallel activation of the sympathetic outflow to the heart, with cardiac noradrenaline spillover to plasma being two times that of subjects with low nerve firing rates (11.0 ± 1.5 vs. 22.0 ± 4.5 ng min⁻¹, P {\textless}0.05). This study indicates that multiple within-burst firing and increased single-unit firing rates of the sympathetic outflow to the skeletal muscle vasculature is associated with high cardiac noradrenaline spillover.},

abstract = {P2Y12 receptor inhibitors are antiplatelet agents commonly prescribed in the treatment of coronary artery disease. Their efficacy can be limited by high on-treatment platelet reactivity (HPR), which can be evaluated by different biological assays. Most commonly, HPR is evaluated by flow cytometric vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein-phosphorylation (VASP-P) assay, which can be time consuming. To evaluate the potential interest of novel technologies, we compared four different assays. Ninety patients receiving P2Y12 inhibitors were included. Four technologies were evaluated: the current standard test measuring VASP-P by flow cytometry, the historical reference test based on light transmittance aggregation (LTA), and two relatively novel techniques: whole blood multiple electrode aggregometry (MEA) and platelet function analyzer (PFA), which are less time consuming. The three latter tests were compared with the VASP-P assay as a reference using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis: LTA has an excellent comparability with the VASP test (ROC AUC {\textgreater} 0.9); the other two tests (multiplate and PFA) have only satisfactory comparability (ROC AUC around 0.7) and therefore may not replace the VASP "gold standard" test, if importance is attached to a quantitative assessment of the substitution parameter of VASP. Nevertheless, if a binary approach of the anti-aggregation result is sought, then one can conclude that the three tests are equivalent since Cohen's kappa coefficients are very close for the three tests (k = 0.548 for LTA; k = 0.554 for MEA; k = 0.570 for PFA/P2Y), and a similar proportion of patients are misclassified (15{\%} for LTA, 14{\%} for MEA, and 13.6{\%} for PFA). Discriminant factor analysis using all the parameters provided by each test did not improve the diagnostic performance of MEA or PFA. In conclusion, only LTA shows a good comparability to the VASP assay using ROC curve analysis, probably because misclassified patients have results close to the cutoff values. All three tests have moderate agreement regarding the classification of patients as responders to P2Y12 inhibition.},

abstract = {Although hypertension is the most prevalent treatable vascular risk factor, how it causes end-organ damage and vascular events is poorly understood. Yet, a widespread belief exists that underlying usual blood pressure can alone account for all blood-pressure-related risk of vascular events and for the benefits of antihypertensive drugs, and this notion has come to underpin all major clinical guidelines on diagnosis and treatment of hypertension. Other potentially informative measures, such as variability in clinic blood pressure or maximum blood pressure reached, have been neglected, and effects of antihypertensive drugs on such measures are largely unknown. Clinical guidelines recommend that episodic hypertension is not treated, and the potential risks of residual variability in blood pressure in treated hypertensive patients have been ignored. This Review discusses shortcomings of the usual blood-pressure hypothesis, provides background to accompanying reports on the importance of blood-pressure variability in prediction of risk of vascular events and in accounting for benefits of antihypertensive drugs, and draws attention to clinical implications and directions for future research.},

abstract = {In physiological hemostasis a prompt recruitment of platelets on the vessel damage prevents the bleeding by the rapid formation of a platelet plug. Qualitative and/or quantitative platelet defects promote bleeding, whereas the high residual reactivity of platelets in patients on antiplatelet therapies moves forward thromboembolic complications. The biochemical mechanisms of the different phases of platelet activation-adhesion, shape change, release reaction, and aggregation-have been well delineated, whereas their complete translation into laboratory assays has not been so fulfilled. Laboratory tests of platelet function, such as bleeding time, light transmission platelet aggregation, lumiaggregometry, impedance aggregometry on whole blood, and platelet activation investigated by flow cytometry, are traditionally utilized for diagnosing hemostatic disorders and managing patients with platelet and hemostatic defects, but their use is still limited to specialized laboratories. To date, a point-of-care testing (POCT) dedicated to platelet function, using pertinent devices much simpler to use, has now become available (ie, PFA-100, VerifyNow System, Multiplate Electrode Aggregometry [MEA]). POCT includes new methodologies which may be used in critical clinical settings and also in general laboratories because they are rapid and easy to use, employing whole blood without the necessity of sample processing. Actually, these different platelet methodologies for the evaluation of inherited and acquired bleeding disorders and/or for monitoring antiplatelet therapies are spreading and the study of platelet function is strengthening. In this review, well-tried and innovative platelet function tests and their methodological features and clinical applications are considered.},

abstract = {The human blood platelet circulates in the blood as a non-adherent disk. Upon receiving signals of blood vessel damage, the platelet reorganizes its actin cytoskeleton which transforms it into a spiky dynamic adherent glue. This transformation involves a temporal sequence of four morphologically distinct steps which is reproducible in vitro. The actin dynamics underlying these shape changes depend on a large number of actin-binding proteins. Maintenance of the discoid shape requires actin-binding proteins that inhibit these reorganizations, whereas transformation involves other proteins, some to disassemble old filaments and others to polymerize new ones. F-Actin-affinity chromatography identified a large set of actin-binding proteins including VASP, Arp2 and 2E4/kaptin. Recent discoveries show that VASP inhibits filament disassembly and Arp2/3 is required to polymerize new filaments. Morphological analysis of the distribution of these actin-binding proteins in spread platelets together with biochemical measurements of their interactions with actin lead to a model of interactions with actin that mediate shape change. {\textcopyright} 2002, Elsevier Science (USA).},

Intra-arterial brachial systolic blood pressure (SBP) was higher than aortic values (8.0 mm Hg; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI]: 5.9 to 10.1 mm Hg; p {\textless} 0.0001) and intra-arterial brachial diastolic BP was lower than aortic values (-1.0 mm Hg; 95{\%} CI: -2.0 to -0.1 mm Hg; p = 0.038).

abstract = {Evidence assembled in this review indicates that sympathetic nervous system dysfunction is crucial in the development of heart failure and essential hypertension. This takes the form of persistent and adverse activation of sympathetic outflows to the heart and kidneys in both conditions. An important goal for clinical scientists is translation of the knowledge of pathophysiology, such as this, into better treatment for patients. The achievement of this 'mechanisms to management' transition is at different stages of development with regard to the two disorders. Clinical translation is mature in cardiac failure, knowledge of cardiac neural pathophysiology having led to the introduction of beta-adrenergic blockers, an effective therapy. With essential hypertension perhaps we are on the cusp of effective translation, with recent successful testing of selective catheter-based renal sympathetic nerve ablation in patients with resistant hypertension, an intervention firmly based on the demonstration of activation of the renal sympathetic outflow. Additional evidence in this regard is provided by the results of pilot studies exploring the possibility to reduce blood pressure in resistant hypertensives through electrical stimulation of the area of carotid baroreceptors. Despite the general importance of the sympathetic nervous system in blood pressure regulation, and the specific demonstration that the blood pressure elevation in essential hypertension is commonly initiated and sustained by sympathetic nervous activation, drugs antagonizing this system are currently underutilized in the care of patients with hypertension. Use of beta-adrenergic blocking drugs is waning, given the propensity of this drug class to have adverse metabolic effects, including predisposition to diabetes development. The blood pressure lowering achieved with carotid baroreceptor stimulation and with the renal denervation device affirms the importance of the sympathetic nervous system in hypertension pathogenesis, and perhaps suggests a wider role for anti-adrenergic antihypertensives, such as the imidazoline drug class (moxonidine, rilmenidine) which act within the CNS to inhibit central sympathetic outflow, although the lack of large-scale outcome trials with this drug class remains a very material deficiency.},

abstract = {Mendelian randomization (MR) is being increasingly used to strengthen causal inference in observational studies. Availability of summary data of genetic associations for a variety of phenotypes from large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) allows straightforward application of MR using summary data methods, typically in a two-sample design. In addition to the conventional inverse variance weighting (IVW) method, recently developed summary data MR methods, such as the MR-Egger and weighted median approaches, allow a relaxation of the instrumental variable assumptions.|Here, a new method - the mode-based estimate (MBE) - is proposed to obtain a single causal effect estimate from multiple genetic instruments. The MBE is consistent when the largest number of similar (identical in infinite samples) individual-instrument causal effect estimates comes from valid instruments, even if the majority of instruments are invalid. We evaluate the performance of the method in simulations designed to mimic the two-sample summary data setting, and demonstrate its use by investigating the causal effect of plasma lipid fractions and urate levels on coronary heart disease risk.|The MBE presented less bias and lower type-I error rates than other methods under the null in many situations. Its power to detect a causal effect was smaller compared with the IVW and weighted median methods, but was larger than that of MR-Egger regression, with sample size requirements typically smaller than those available from GWAS consortia.|The MBE relaxes the instrumental variable assumptions, and should be used in combination with other approaches in sensitivity analyses.},

We identified 3290 and 941 near-independent SNPs associated with height and BMI, respectively (at a revised genome-wide significance threshold of P {\textless} 1 × 10-8), including 1185 height-associated SNPs and 751 BMI-associated SNPs located within loci not previously identified by these two GWAS. The near-independent genome-wide significant SNPs explain ∼24.6{\%} of the variance of height and ∼6.0{\%} of the variance of BMI in an independent sample from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). Correlations between polygenic scores based upon these SNPs with actual height and BMI in HRS participants were ∼0.44 and ∼0.22, respectively. From analyses of integrating GWAS and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data by summary-data-based Mendelian randomization, we identified an enrichment of eQTLs among lead height and BMI signals, prioritizing 610 and 138 genes, respectively. Our study demonstrates that, as previously predicted, increasing GWAS sample sizes continues to deliver, by the discovery of new loci, increasing prediction accuracy and providing additional data to achieve deeper insight into complex trait biology. All summary statistics are made available for follow-up studies.},

The number of risk factors measured in 12- to 18-year-old adolescents, including high levels (ie, extreme age- and sex-specific 80th percentile) of LDL-C, systolic blood pressure, body mass index, and cigarette smoking, were directly related to carotid IMT measured in young adults at ages 33 through 39 years (P{\textless}.001 for both men and women), and remained significant after adjustment for contemporaneous risk variables. The number of risk factors measured at ages 3 to 9 years demonstrated a weak direct relationship with carotid IMT at ages 24 to 30 years in men (P =.02) but not in women (P =.63).|Risk factor profile assessed in 12- to 18-year-old adolescents predicts adult common carotid artery IMT independently of contemporaneous risk factors.

Compared with individuals with a normal BMI (defined as a BMI of 18.5 to 24.9), lifetime risks for incident CVD were higher in middle-aged adults in the overweight and obese groups. Compared with normal weight, among middle-aged men and women, competing hazard ratios for incident CVD were 1.21 (95{\%} CI, 1.14-1.28) and 1.32 (95{\%} CI, 1.24-1.40), respectively, for overweight (BMI, 25.0-29.9), 1.67 (95{\%} CI, 1.55-1.79) and 1.85 (95{\%} CI, 1.72-1.99) for obesity (BMI, 30.0-39.9), and 3.14 (95{\%} CI, 2.48-3.97) and 2.53 (95{\%} CI, 2.20-2.91) for morbid obesity (BMI, ≥40.0). Higher BMI had the strongest association with incident heart failure among CVD subtypes. Average years lived with CVD were longer for middle-aged adults in the overweight and obese groups compared with adults in the normal BMI group. Similar patterns were observed in younger and older adults.|In this study, obesity was associated with shorter longevity and significantly increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality compared with normal BMI. Despite similar longevity compared with normal BMI, overweight was associated with significantly increased risk of developing CVD at an earlier age, resulting in a greater proportion of life lived with CVD morbidity.},

abstract = {Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) has been the central parameter used for diagnosis and management in patients with heart failure. A good predictor of adverse outcomes in heart failure when below ∼45{\%}, LVEF is less useful as a marker of risk as it approaches normal. As a measure of cardiac function, ejection fraction has several important limitations. Calculated as the stroke volume divided by end-diastolic volume, the estimation of ejection fraction is generally based on geometric assumptions that allow for assessment of volumes based on linear or two-dimensional measurements. Left ventricular ejection fraction is both preload- and afterload-dependent, can change substantially based on loading conditions, is only moderately reproducible, and represents only a single measure of risk in patients with heart failure. Moreover, the relationship between ejection fraction and risk in patients with heart failure is modified by factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and renal function. A more complete evaluation and understanding of left ventricular function in patients with heart failure requires a more comprehensive assessment: we conceptualize an integrative approach that incorporates measures of left and right ventricular function, left ventricular geometry, left atrial size, and valvular function, as well as non-imaging factors (such as clinical parameters and biomarkers), providing a comprehensive and accurate prediction of risk in heart failure.},

We determined TFPI activity and TFPI-free and total antigen levels in the subjects enrolled in the Leiden Thrombophilia Study, which is a large population-based case-control study of 474 patients and 474 controls. The odds ratio (OR) for DVT in subjects who had TFPI-free antigen levels below the 10th percentile, as compared with those who had TFPI-free antigen levels above this cutoff, was 1.7 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.1-2.6). The ORs for low TFPI activity and low total antigen were also mildly increased. When the 5th percentile was used as a cutoff, the ORs were 2.1 (95{\%} CI, 1.1-4.1) for both TFPI-free antigen and TFPI total antigen. Exogenous female hormones had a profound lowering effect on TFPI levels, with lower levels in oral contraceptive users than in premenopausal nonusers, who had lower levels than men and postmenopausal women. These results indicate that low levels of TFPI, especially low TFPI-free and total antigen in plasma, constitute a risk factor for DVT.},

abstract = {The cardiovascular response to exercise is abnormally large in hypertension. Over the past decade, it has become clear that the exercise pressor reflex (a peripheral feed-back mechanism originating in skeletal muscle) contributes significantly to the generation of this hyper-responsiveness. Further, it has been determined that overactivity of the mechanically (muscle mechanoreflex) and chemically (muscle metaboreflex) sensitive components of the exercise pressor reflex underpin its dysfunction. Given the recent attention in the literature, this review focuses upon the aberrant function of the muscle mechanoreflex in this disease. Evidence supporting a role for the mechanoreflex in the pathogenesis of the exaggerated cardiovascular response to physical activity is highlighted. The peripheral and central mechanisms that may be responsible for mechanoreflex overactivity in hypertension are likewise discussed. Particular attention is given to emerging evidence implicating a role for centrally-derived nitric oxide in this process.},

Data were analyzed from October 2016 to July 2017.|World Health Organization-standardized BMI categories.|Total CVD and CVD subtype, including fatal and nonfatal coronary heart disease, stroke, congestive heart failure, and other CVD deaths. Heights and weights were measured directly by investigators in each study, and BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. We performed (1) modified Kaplan-Meier analysis to estimate lifetime risks, (2) adjusted competing Cox models to estimate joint cumulative risks for CVD or noncardiovascular death, and (3) the Irwin restricted mean to estimate years lived free of and with CVD.|Of the 190 672 in-person examinations included in this study, the mean (SD) age was 46.0 (15.0) years for men and 58.7 (12.9) years for women, and 140 835 patients (73.9{\%}) were female. Compared with individuals with a normal BMI (defined as a BMI of 18.5 to 24.9), lifetime risks for incident CVD were higher in middle-aged adults in the overweight and obese groups. Compared with normal weight, among middle-aged men and women, competing hazard ratios for incident CVD were 1.21 (95{\%} CI, 1.14-1.28) and 1.32 (95{\%} CI, 1.24-1.40), respectively, for overweight (BMI, 25.0-29.9), 1.67 (95{\%} CI, 1.55-1.79) and 1.85 (95{\%} CI, 1.72-1.99) for obesity (BMI, 30.0-39.9), and 3.14 (95{\%} CI, 2.48-3.97) and 2.53 (95{\%} CI, 2.20-2.91) for morbid obesity (BMI, ≥40.0). Higher BMI had the strongest association with incident heart failure among CVD subtypes. Average years lived with CVD were longer for middle-aged adults in the overweight and obese groups compared with adults in the normal BMI group. Similar patterns were observed in younger and older adults.|In this study, obesity was associated with shorter longevity and significantly increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality compared with normal BMI. Despite similar longevity compared with normal BMI, overweight was associated with significantly increased risk of developing CVD at an earlier age, resulting in a greater proportion of life lived with CVD morbidity.},

abstract = {Background: Type 2 diabetes is a chronic disorder that requires lifelong treatment. We aimed to assess whether intensive weight management within routine primary care would achieve remission of type 2 diabetes. Methods: We did this open-label, cluster-randomised trial (DiRECT) at 49 primary care practices in Scotland and the Tyneside region of England. Practices were randomly assigned (1:1), via a computer-generated list, to provide either a weight management programme (intervention) or best-practice care by guidelines (control), with stratification for study site (Tyneside or Scotland) and practice list size ({\textgreater}5700 or ≤5700). Participants, carers, and research assistants who collected outcome data were aware of group allocation; however, allocation was concealed from the study statistician. We recruited individuals aged 20–65 years who had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes within the past 6 years, had a body-mass index of 27–45 kg/m2, and were not receiving insulin. The intervention comprised withdrawal of antidiabetic and antihypertensive drugs, total diet replacement (825–853 kcal/day formula diet for 3–5 months), stepped food reintroduction (2–8 weeks), and structured support for long-term weight loss maintenance. Co-primary outcomes were weight loss of 15 kg or more, and remission of diabetes, defined as glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) of less than 6{\textperiodcentered}5{\%} ({\textless}48 mmol/mol) after at least 2 months off all antidiabetic medications, from baseline to 12 months. These outcomes were analysed hierarchically. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number 03267836. Findings: Between July 25, 2014, and Aug 5, 2017, we recruited 306 individuals from 49 intervention (n=23) and control (n=26) general practices; 149 participants per group comprised the intention-to-treat population. At 12 months, we recorded weight loss of 15 kg or more in 36 (24{\%}) participants in the intervention group and no participants in the control group (p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001). Diabetes remission was achieved in 68 (46{\%}) participants in the intervention group and six (4{\%}) participants in the control group (odds ratio 19{\textperiodcentered}7, 95{\%} CI 7{\textperiodcentered}8–49{\textperiodcentered}8; p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001). Remission varied with weight loss in the whole study population, with achievement in none of 76 participants who gained weight, six (7{\%}) of 89 participants who maintained 0–5 kg weight loss, 19 (34{\%}) of 56 participants with 5–10 kg loss, 16 (57{\%}) of 28 participants with 10–15 kg loss, and 31 (86{\%}) of 36 participants who lost 15 kg or more. Mean bodyweight fell by 10{\textperiodcentered}0 kg (SD 8{\textperiodcentered}0) in the intervention group and 1{\textperiodcentered}0 kg (3{\textperiodcentered}7) in the control group (adjusted difference −8{\textperiodcentered}8 kg, 95{\%} CI −10{\textperiodcentered}3 to −7{\textperiodcentered}3; p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001). Quality of life, as measured by the EuroQol 5 Dimensions visual analogue scale, improved by 7{\textperiodcentered}2 points (SD 21{\textperiodcentered}3) in the intervention group, and decreased by 2{\textperiodcentered}9 points (15{\textperiodcentered}5) in the control group (adjusted difference 6{\textperiodcentered}4 points, 95{\%} CI 2{\textperiodcentered}5–10{\textperiodcentered}3; p=0{\textperiodcentered}0012). Nine serious adverse events were reported by seven (4{\%}) of 157 participants in the intervention group and two were reported by two (1{\%}) participants in the control group. Two serious adverse events (biliary colic and abdominal pain), occurring in the same participant, were deemed potentially related to the intervention. No serious adverse events led to withdrawal from the study. Interpretation: Our findings show that, at 12 months, almost half of participants achieved remission to a non-diabetic state and off antidiabetic drugs. Remission of type 2 diabetes is a practical target for primary care. Funding: Diabetes UK.},

The new conception of obesity as a basal inflammatory condition has opened a new window of possibilities to identify inflammatory biomarkers to be used in the diagnosis or prognosis of obesity-associated comorbidities. This present work aims the identification of the adipokines (leptin and resistin), chemokines (CCL2, CCL5, CXCL16) and the BMP-2 and their association with the clinical, biochemical (fasting glucose, hemogram, cholesterol, T3, T4 and TSH) and anthropometric (weight, height, body circumferences, skinfold thickness and percentage of body fat) parameters in young adults (18-30 years old) presenting obesity and overweight. Our data showed increasing in anthropometric parameters and in the plasma inflammatory levels in those individuals presenting overweight and obesity. We observed a higher plasma levels of CCL2, CCL5, CXCL16, leptin and resistin in those overweigh and obese individuals. In addition, the CCL2, CCL5 presented a positive correlation with the body mass index and the body fat percentage. Assuming the obesity as a systemic inflammatory process, in this current study, the overweight individuals possess a close similar pattern of circulating inflammatory mediators which might be a potential risk of the development of obesity comorbidities. Further studies are still needed to precise the role of the biomarkers CCL2, CCL5, CXCL16 and BMP-2 in the clinical prognosis related to the overweight or obese individuals.},

Part of this statistic likely stems from a parallel increase in the prevalence of obesity and metabolic dysfunction, both significant risk factors for coronary disease. Obesity and diabetes pose unique challenges for the heart and their impact on the coronary vasculature remains incompletely understood. The vascular endothelium is a major interface between arterial function and the physical and chemical components of blood flow. Proper function of the endothelium is necessary to preserve hemostasis, maintain vascular tone and limit the extent of vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis. Given its central role in vascular health, endothelial dysfunction has been the source of considerable research interest in diabetes and obesity. In the current review, we will examine the pathologic impact of obesity and diabetes on coronary function and the extent to which these two factors impact endothelial function.

Overall, 84 records were identified, and 23 publications were enrolled into the current study.

abstract = {A pattern of left ventricular hypertrophy evident on the electrocardiogram is a harbinger of morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease. Echocardiography permits the noninvasive determination of left ventricular mass and the examination of its role as a precursor of morbidity and mortality. We examined the relation of left ventricular mass to the incidence of cardiovascular disease, mortality from cardiovascular disease, and mortality from all causes in 3220 subjects enrolled in the Framingham Heart Study who were 40 years of age or older and free of clinically apparent cardiovascular disease, in whom left ventricular mass was determined echocardiographically. During a four-year follow-up period, there were 208 incident cardiovascular events, 37 deaths from cardiovascular disease, and 124 deaths from all causes. Left ventricular mass, determined echocardiographically, was associated with all outcome events. This relation persisted after we adjusted for age, diastolic blood pressure, pulse pressure, treatment for hypertension, cigarette smoking, diabetes, obesity, the ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and electrocardiographic evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy. In men, the risk factor-adjusted relative risk of cardiovascular disease was 1.49 for each increment of 50 g per meter in left ventricular mass corrected for the subject's height (95 percent confidence interval, 1.20 to 1.85); in women, it was 1.57 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.20 to 2.04). Left ventricular mass (corrected for height) was also associated with the incidence of death from cardiovascular disease (relative risk, 1.73 [95 percent confidence interval, 1.19 to 2.52] in men and 2.12 [95 percent confidence interval, 1.28 to 3.49] in women). Left ventricular mass (corrected for height) was associated with death from all causes (relative risk, 1.49 [95 percent confidence interval, 1.14 to 1.94] in men and 2.01 [95 percent confidence interval, 1.44 to 2.81] in women). We conclude that the estimation of left ventricular mass by echocardiography offers prognostic information beyond that provided by the evaluation of traditional cardiovascular risk factors. An increase in left ventricular mass predicts a higher incidence of clinical events, including death, attributable to cardiovascular disease.},

abstract = {visit-to-visit variability (VVV) of clinic systolic blood pressure (SBP) has been associated with cardiovascular disease risk. Given the need for obtaining blood pressure (BP) at multiple visits to calculate VVV, substituting BP variability from ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) may be a practical alternative. We assessed the correlation between VVV of BP and BP variability from ABPM using data from 146 untreated, mostly normotensive participants (mean age 47.9 years), in a substudy of the ongoing Masked Hypertension Study. VVV of SBP and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was estimated by the standard deviation (s.d.vvv) and average real variability (ARVvvv) from six study visits over a median of 216 days. ABPM data were used to calculate the day-night s.d. (s.d.dn), and the ARV of SBP and DBP over 24 h (ARV24). For SBP, the mean s.d.vvv and s.d.dn were 6.3 (s.d.=2.5) and 8.8 mm Hg (s.d.=1.8), respectively, and mean ARVvvv and ARV24 were 7.2 (s.d.=3.2) and 8.4 mm Hg (s.d.=2.1), respectively. Spearman's correlation coefficient between s.d.vvv and s.d.dn of SBP was rs=0.25, and between ARVvvv and ARV24 was rs=0.17. Participants in the highest quartile of s.d.dn of SBP were 1.66 (95{\%} CI: 0.93-2.75) times more likely to be in the highest quartile of s.d.vvv of SBP. The observed-to-expected ratio between the highest quartiles of ARVvvv and ARV24 of SBP was 0.89 (95{\%} CI: 0.41-1.69). The correlations for s.d.vvv and s.d.dn, and ARVvvv and ARV24 of DBP were minimal. These data suggest VVV and 24-h variability are weakly correlated and not interchangeable.},

abstract = {While there are many bench and bedside tests to assess platelet reactivity, ex vivo light transmission aggregometry (LTA) remains the gold standard. LTA, however, is expensive, time-consuming and requires dedicated equipment and staff, making it impractical in many situations. In addition, there is significant variability between data generated at different testing sites meaning that tests often need to be repeated if a patient is transferred to the care of a different hospital. As such, there is clearly an unmet need for standardization of platelet testing. Using the principles of LTA, aggregometry can be conducted in 96-well plates with readings being made in a standard plate reader. This approach allows for the assessment of multiple concentrations of agonists, since the volume of platelets required for each test is significantly lower than for LTA. Furthermore, the lyophilization of a set panel of agonists to a 96-well plate to produce a stable assay substrate allows the production of portable, standardized plates that can be used to generate reproducible tests at multiple sites. In this review, we will discuss the methods and uses of 96-well plate aggregometry for both research and the clinic.},

abstract = {Platelets participate in inflammatory disorders through a variety of different functional responses, including chemotaxis, platelet-leukocyte complex formation and facilitation of leukocyte recruitment that are thought to be distinct from platelet aggregation. This may account for why classical anti-platelet drugs have failed to ameliorate inflammatory disorders where platelets are known to participate, suggesting that distinct pathways may control inflammatory and haemostatic functions of platelets. In the present study, we have therefore investigated the effect of different stimuli on several different functions of platelets preferentially involved either in haemostasis or in inflammation.|Human platelets were stimulated with either inflammatory (fMLP, histamine, IL-1$\beta$, LPS, MDC/CCL22, SDF-1$\alpha$/CXCL12 and 5-HT) or haemostatic (ADP, collagen, convulxin, epinephrine, TRAP-6 and U46619) stimuli. Aggregation, platelet-leukocyte complex formation, platelet migration and platelet protein phosphorylation were assessed.|Haemostatic stimuli induced platelet aggregation, whilst inflammatory agonists induced platelet migration. The haemostatic stimuli, with the exception of epinephrine, and some of the inflammatory stimuli induced platelet-leukocyte complex formation, even if to a different extent. Furthermore, inflammatory stimuli induced a shorter lasting profile of platelet protein phosphorylation compared with haemostatic stimuli.|Stimulation of platelets with inflammatory stimuli triggers the activation of non haemostatic functions different from those induced by haemostatic stimuli, supporting the existence of alternative platelet responses depending on the stimulus (haemostatic or inflammatory). A deeper understanding of the biochemical pathways behind these functional differences may lead to the development of novel therapeutic options targeting the inflammatory actions of platelets, without affecting their critical role in haemostasis.},

Procoagulant platelets are an example of such subpopulations, a key characteristic of which is exposure either of the anionic aminophospholipid phosphatidylserine (PS) or of tissue factor on the activated platelet surface. This review focuses on the former, in which PS exposure on a subpopulation of platelets facilitates assembly of the intrinsic tenase and prothrombinase complexes, thereby accelerating thrombin generation on the activated platelet surface, contributing importantly to the hemostatic process. Mechanisms involved in platelet PS exposure, and accompanying events, induced by physiologically relevant agonists are considered then contrasted with PS exposure resulting from intrinsic pathway-mediated apoptosis in platelets. Pathologies of PS exposure, both inherited and acquired, are described. A consideration of platelet PS exposure as an antithrombotic target concludes the review.},

To assess the potential role of tumor necrosis factor in the pathogenesis of cardiac cachexia, we measured serum levels of the factor in 33 patients with chronic heart failure, 33 age-matched healthy controls, and 9 patients with chronic renal failure.|Mean (+/- SEM) serum levels of tumor necrosis factor were higher in the patients with heart failure (115 +/- 25 U per milliliter) than in the healthy controls (9 +/- 3 U per milliliter; P less than 0.001). Nineteen of the patients with chronic heart failure had serum levels of tumor necrosis factor greater than or equal to 39 U per milliliter (greater than 2 SD above the mean value for the control group), whereas the remaining 14 patients had serum levels of tumor necrosis factor below this level. The patients with high levels of tumor necrosis factor were more cachectic than those with low levels (82 +/- 3 vs. 95 +/- 6 percent of ideal body weight, respectively; P less than 0.05) and had more advanced heart failure, as evidenced by their higher values for plasma renin activity (2.92 +/- 0.53 vs. 1.06 +/- 0.53 ng per liter per second [10.5 +/- 1.9 vs. 3.8 +/- 1.9 ng per milliliter per hour]; P less than 0.01) and lower serum sodium concentration (135 +/- 1 vs. 138 +/- 1 mmol per liter; P less than 0.05).

In a sample of 3200 individuals, randomly selected from the general population of Monza (Milan, Italy), we evaluated BP by an automatic oscillometric device every 20 minutes for 24 hours and left ventricular mass index (LVMI) by echocardiography. In each subject, individual systolic and diastolic BP readings were averaged to obtain a 24-hour mean. Systolic BPV was obtained by calculating (1) the standard deviation of the 24-hour mean, which was taken as the overall BPV, (2) the cyclic components (Fourier spectral analysis) that in the population as a whole explained {\textgreater}95{\%} of the overall BPV, and (3) the fraction of the overall BPV that in each subject was not accounted for by the 2 cyclic components, termed individual residual BPV. A similar procedure was used for diastolic BP and heart rate. Participation rate was 64.1{\%}. Patients receiving antihypertensive therapy (n=403) were excluded from the analysis, which was therefore limited to 1648 participants. In the population as a whole, LVMI significantly related to 24-hour systolic and diastolic BP mean (beta=0.40 and beta=0.37, respectively, P{\textless}0.001 for both) but not to the 2 cyclic components that accounted for most of the BPV. On the other hand, the individual residual BPV (which accounts on average for about 50{\%} of overall BPV) showed a significant positive relationship with LVMI (beta =0.38 and beta=0.88 for systolic and diastolic BP, respectively, P{\textless}0.05 and P{\textless}0.01). No relationship was found between LVMI and heart rate values. These findings provide evidence that there is a relationship between LVMI and 24-hour average BP values in the population. They also provide the first demonstration that in the population there is also a positive independent association between LVMI and BPV. This association, however, can be exclusively seen with the BPV component that has an erratic rather than a cyclic nature.},

Non-dipping phenomenon was present in 63 (55 {\%}) studies (non-dippers). The LVMI adjusted for age was not significantly different between non-dippers and dippers (0.87 ± 0.03 vs. 0.81 ± 0.02, p = 0.13). Left ventricular hypertrophy was not significantly higher in non-dippers than in dippers (20 vs. 9 {\%}, p = 0.12).|Hypertensive children without end-stage renal failure with non-dipping phenomenon do not have increased prevalence of LVH or higher LVMI adjusted for age than hypertensive children with preserved nocturnal BP dip.|• Adult and pediatric hypertensive patients with end-stage renal failure have often nocturnal blood pressure non-dipping phenomenon. • Non-dipping phenomenon is in patients with end-stage renal failure associated with increased prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy. What is New: • Pediatric hypertensive patients without end-stage renal failure with blood pressure non-dipping phenomenon do not have increased prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy.},

abstract = {Blood platelets are anucleated circulating cells that play a critical role in hemostasis and are also implicated in arterial thrombosis, a major cause of death worldwide. The biological function of platelets strongly relies in their reactiveness to a variety of extracellular agonists that regulate their adhesion to extracellular matrix at the site of vascular injury and their ability to form rapidly growing cell aggregates. Among the membrane receptors expressed on the cell surface, integrins are crucial for both platelet activation, adhesion and aggregation. Integrin affinity for specific ligands is regulated by intracellular signaling pathways activated in stimulated platelets, and, once engaged, integrins themselves generate and propagate signals inside the cells to reinforce and consolidate platelet response and thrombus formation. Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases (PI3Ks) have emerged as crucial players in platelet activation, and they are directly implicated in the regulation of integrin function. This review will discuss the contribution of PI3Ks in platelet integrin signaling, focusing on the role of specific members of class I PI3Ks and their downstream effector Akt on both integrin inside-out and outside-in signaling. The contribution of the PI3K/Akt pathways stimulated by integrin engagement and platelet activation in thrombus formation and stabilization will also be discussed in order to highlight the possibility to target these enzymes in effective anti-thrombotic therapeutic strategies.},

abstract = {Aims To appraise the clinical and genetic evidence that low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) cause atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Methods and results We assessed whether the association between LDL and ASCVD fulfils the criteria for causality by evaluating the totality of evidence from genetic studies, prospective epidemiologic cohort studies, Mendelian randomization studies, and randomized trials of LDL-lowering therapies. In clinical studies, plasma LDL burden is usually estimated by determination of plasma LDL cholesterol level (LDL-C). Rare genetic mutations that cause reduced LDL receptor function lead to markedly higher LDL-C and a dose-dependent increase in the risk of ASCVD, whereas rare variants leading to lower LDL-C are associated with a correspondingly lower risk of ASCVD. Separate meta-analyses of over 200 prospective cohort studies, Mendelian randomization studies, and randomized trials including more than 2 million participants with over 20 million person-years of follow-up and over 150 000 cardiovascular events demonstrate a remarkably consistent dose-dependent log-linear association between the absolute magnitude of exposure of the vasculature to LDL-C and the risk of ASCVD; and this effect appears to increase with increasing duration of exposure to LDL-C. Both the naturally randomized genetic studies and the randomized intervention trials consistently demonstrate that any mechanism of lowering plasma LDL particle concentration should reduce the risk of ASCVD events proportional to the absolute reduction in LDL-C and the cumulative duration of exposure to lower LDL-C, provided that the achieved reduction in LDL-C is concordant with the reduction in LDL particle number and that there are no competing deleterious off-target effects. Conclusion Consistent evidence from numerous and multiple different types of clinical and genetic studies unequivocally establishes that LDL causes ASCVD.},

abstract = {Chapter 47 - Volume-Reduced Blood Products
Volume reduction (also known as hyperpacking or hyperconcentrating), a process performed after a blood component has been manufactured, is the removal of a portion of the supernatant of a cellular blood product such as an RBC or platelet unit. The supernatant contains residual plasma and anticoagulant-preservative solution, and its removal results in a more concentrated cellular product. This procedure is performed more often in the pediatric than the adult setting. In general, volume reduction requires a centrifugation step followed by expression of the supernatant fluid and is performed on request, immediately before issue from the hospital blood bank to the patient for administration. Most transfusion authorities suggest that this process modification should only be used in explicitly indicated circumstances, including prevention of transfusion of unnecessary fluid to a volume-sensitive patient, and for the removal of the potassium-containing supernatant to prevent hyperkalemia in an at-risk patient.},

The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the brain is involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension. This study was designed to determine whether inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in the PVN modulates cytokines and attenuates oxidative stress (ROS) in the RVLM, and decreases the blood pressure and sympathetic activity in renovascular hypertensive rats. Renovascular hypertension was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats by the two-kidney one-clip (2K1C) method. Renovascular hypertensive rats received bilateral PVN infusion with ACE inhibitor lisinopril (LSP, 10$\mu$g/h) or vehicle via osmotic minipump for 4weeks. Mean arterial pressure (MAP), renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA), and plasma proinflammatory cytokines (PICs) were significantly increased in renovascular hypertensive rats. The renovascular hypertensive rats also had higher levels of ACE in the PVN, and lower level of interleukin-10 (IL-10) in the RVLM. In addition, the levels of PICs, the chemokine MCP-1, the subunit of NAD(P)H oxidase (gp91(phox)) and ROS in the RVLM were increased in hypertensive rats. PVN treatment with LSP attenuated those changes occurring in renovascular hypertensive rats. Our findings suggest that the beneficial effects of ACE inhibition in the PVN in renovascular hypertension are partly due to modulation cytokines and attenuation oxidative stress in the RVLM.},

In addition, we present three case studies that illustrate the value of this platform. The first uses EpiGraphDB to evaluate potential pleiotropic relationships, addressing mis-inference in systematic causal analysis. In the second case study, we illustrate how protein-protein interaction data offer opportunities to identify new drug targets.

@article{Kowalska2000,
abstract = {Platelets play roles in both thrombosis and inflammation, and chemokines that are released at sites of inflammation could potentially activate platelets. Among the chemokine receptors expressed on platelets, the CXCR4 is the receptor for chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), and the CCR4 is the receptor for macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC). Of the chemokines tested, SDF-1 and MDC were the only 2 that activated platelets. Both are weak agonists, but they enhanced response to low-dose adenosine 5'- diphosphate (ADP), epinephrine, or serotonin. When SDF-1 and MDC were added together, full and brisk platelet aggregation occurred. Platelet activation by these 2 chemokines appears to involve distinct pathways: SDF-1 inhibited an increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) following prostaglandin (PG) I2, while MDC had no effect, in contrast, MDC, but not SDF-1, lead to Ca++ mobilization by platelets. Further, second-wave aggregation induced by MDC in platelet-rich plasma was inhibited by aspirin, ADP scavenger creatine phosphate/creative phosphokinase (CP/CPK), and ARL-66096, an antagonist of the ADP P2T(AC) receptor involved in adenylyl cyclase inhibition. But the aggregation was not affected by A3P5PS, an inhibitor of the ADP P2Y receptor. SDF-1-induced aggregation was inhibited by aspirin, but it was only slightly affected by CP/CPK, ARL-66096, or A3P5PS. Finally, the presence of chemokines in platelets was determined. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction studies with platelet RNA did not detect the presence of SDF-1 or MDC. In summary, SDF-1 and MDC are platelet agonists that activate distinct intracellular pathways. Their importance in the development of thrombosis at sites of inflammation needs to be further evaluated. (C) 2000 by The American Society of Hematology.},

abstract = {Heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF) is an increasingly prevalent clinical syndrome with many unresolved issues regarding diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment. The major pathophysiological mechanisms underlying HFPEF are known to be fibrosis and reduced ventricular compliance, and hypertension (HTN) is perhaps the most significant risk factor for the development of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD). Inflammation is one of the earliest events in cardiac stress situations such as pressure and/or volume overload and involves elevated levels of endothelial adhesion molecules as well as increased production and release of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the tissue. The latter promotes the infiltration of activated inflammatory cells, particularly monocytes, into the cardiac tissue. Increased monocyte infiltration is seen in the early and late stages of HTN and HFPEF. Once inside the tissue, monocytes differentiate into macrophages and promote cardiac inflammation, tissue injury, and myocardial fibrosis. This review focuses on inflammation as the initial and primary trigger of ventricular remodelling in HTN and LVDD, affecting progression to HFPEF. The link between inflammation and b-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), a clinical marker of cardiac pressure overload which is positively associated with cardiac dysfunction and HF, is also described. Finally, current and prospective therapeutic approaches for HFPEF based on modification of the inflammatory response are reviewed.},

We performed a meta-analysis on individual data of 3468 patients from 4 prospective studies performed in Europe. Age of the subjects averaged 61+/-13 years, 45{\%} were men, 13.7{\%} smoked, 8.4{\%} had diabetes, and 61{\%} were under antihypertensive treatment at the time of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Office, daytime, and nighttime blood pressure averaged 159+/-20/91+/-12, 143+/-17/87+/-12, and 130+/-18/75+/-12 mm Hg. Total follow-up amounted to 23 164 patient-years. We used multivariable Cox regression analysis to assess the hazard ratios associated with 1 standard deviation higher blood pressure. Daytime and nighttime systolic blood pressure predicted all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, coronary heart disease, and stroke, independently from office blood pressure and confounding variables. When these blood pressures were entered simultaneously into the models, nighttime blood pressure predicted all outcomes, whereas daytime blood pressure did not add prognostic precision to nighttime pressure. Appropriate interaction terms indicated that the results were similar in men and women, in younger and older patients, and in treated and untreated patients The systolic night-day blood pressure ratio predicted all outcomes, which only persisted for all-cause mortality after adjustment for 24-hour blood pressure. In conclusion, nighttime blood pressure is in general a better predictor of outcome than daytime pressure in hypertensive patients, and the night-day blood pressure ratio predicts mortality, even after adjustment for 24-hour blood pressure.},

Experiments were conducted 1-3 mo after implantation of ultrasonic transducers to measure LV internal diameter and wall thickness, and miniature LV pressure gauges and aortic and left atrial catheters. In 10 intact, tranquilized baboons, rapid volume loading with saline increased LV end-diastolic pressure by 23.7+/-2.6 mm Hg, LV end-diastolic diameter by 7.8+/-1.5{\%}, LV stroke work by 37.5+/-7.8{\%}, while mean arterial pressure and peak LV wall stress did not change significantly. Despite the increase in preload and activation of the Frank-Starling mechanism, LV dP/dt(max) and the maximum velocity of myocardial fiber shortening (LV dD/dt(max)) did not change. Volume loading after beta-adrenergic or combined beta-adrenergic and cholinergic blockades or volume loading with blood instead of saline also failed to augment LV dP/dt(max) and LV dD/dt(max) despite the increase in preload. In order to volume load the baboons in the conscious state, a radiofrequency (RF) interrogator system was devised, which upon receipt of a radio command, activated a battery operated pump to infuse 1,000 ml of saline i.v. to the baboons. In these experiments, preload rose, i.e., LV end-diastolic diameter increased by 13.9+/-2.1{\%} and the Frank-Starling mechanism could be demonstrated, i.e., stroke work rose by 42.8+/-7.4{\%}, but LV dP/dt(max) and LV dD/dt(max) did not change. After preload was depressed by hemorrhage, the rapid infusion of either blood or saline increased LV dP/dt(max) by 92.7+/-18.5{\%} and LV dD/dt(max) by 64.3+/-10.1{\%}. Thus, acute volume loading in the conscious baboons increased LV end-diastolic size and even stroke work substantially. However, preload dependency of LV dP/dt(max) and the maximum velocity of myocardial fiber shortening was only encountered at low levels of LV preload.},

Active treatment consisted of nitrendipine (10-40 mg/day) with possible addition of enalapril (5-20 mg/day) and/or hydrochlorothiazide (12.5-25.0 mg/day). We assessed whether on-treatment systolic blood pressure level (SBP), visit-to-visit variability independent of the mean (VIM) or within-visit variability (WVV) predicted total (n = 286) or cardiovascular (n = 150) mortality or cardiovascular (n = 347), cerebrovascular (n = 133) or cardiac (n = 217) endpoints.|At 2 years, mean between-group differences were 10.5 mm Hg (p{\textless}0.0001) for SBP, 0.29 units (p = 0.20) for VIM, and 0.07 mm Hg (p = 0.47) for WVV. Active treatment reduced (p≤0.048) cardiovascular (-28{\%}), cerebrovascular (-40{\%}) and cardiac (-24{\%}) endpoints. In analyses dichotomised by the median, patients with low vs. high VIM had similar event rates (p≥0.14). Low vs. high WVV was not associated with event rates (p≥0.095), except for total and cardiovascular mortality on active treatment, which were higher with low WVV (p≤0.0003). In multivariable-adjusted Cox models, SBP predicted all endpoints (p≤0.0043), whereas VIM did not predict any (p≥0.058). Except for an inverse association with total mortality (p = 0.042), WVV was not predictive (p≥0.15). Sensitivity analyses, from which we excluded blood pressure readings within 6 months after randomisation, 6 months prior to an event or both were confirmatory.|The double-blind placebo-controlled Syst-Eur trial demonstrated that blood-pressure lowering treatment reduces cardiovascular complications by decreasing level but not variability of SBP.

abstract = {There is a growing body of evidence to support a connection between diabetes (predominantly type 2), obesity and cancer. Multiple meta-analyses of epidemiological data show that people with diabetes are at increased risk of developing many different types of cancers, along with an increased risk of cancer mortality. Several pathophysiological mechanisms for this relationship have been postulated, including insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemia, enhanced inflammatory processes, dysregulation of sex hormone production and hyperglycaemia. In addition to these potential mechanisms, a number of common risk factors, including obesity, may be behind the association between diabetes and cancer. Indeed, obesity is associated with an increased risk of cancer and diabetes. Abdominal adiposity has been shown to play a role in creating a systemic pro-inflammatory environment, which could result in the development of both diabetes and cancer. Here, we examine the relationship between diabetes, obesity and cancer, and investigate the potential underlying causes of increased cancer risk in individuals with diabetes. Current treatment recommendations for reducing the overall disease burden are also explored and possible areas for future research are considered.},

Sphingosine kinases (Sphk) 1 and 2 catalyze the conversion of sphingosine to the bioactive metabolite sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P). Although platelets are able to secrete S1P on activation, little is known about a potential intrinsic effect of S1P on platelet function.|To investigate the role of Sphk1- and Sphk2-derived S1P in the regulation of platelet function.|We found a 100-fold reduction in intracellular S1P levels in platelets derived from Sphk2(-/-) mutants compared with Sphk1(-/-) or wild-type mice, as analyzed by mass spectrometry. Sphk2(-/-) platelets also failed to secrete S1P on stimulation. Blood from Sphk2-deficient mice showed decreased aggregation after protease-activated receptor 4-peptide and adenosine diphosphate stimulation in vitro, as assessed by whole blood impedance aggregometry. We revealed that S1P controls platelet aggregation via the sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 through modulation of protease-activated receptor 4-peptide and adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet activation. Finally, we show by intravital microscopy that defective platelet aggregation in Sphk2-deficient mice translates into reduced arterial thrombus stability in vivo.|We demonstrate that Sphk2 is the major Sphk isoform responsible for the generation of S1P in platelets and plays a pivotal intrinsic role in the control of platelet activation. Correspondingly, Sphk2-deficient mice are protected from arterial thrombosis after vascular injury, but have normal bleeding times. Targeting this pathway could therefore present a new therapeutic strategy to prevent thrombosis.},

abstract = {Evidence from both experimental and clinical trials indicates that inflammatory mediators are of importance in the pathogenesis of chronic heart failure (HF) contributing to cardiac remodeling and peripheral vascular disturbances. Several studies have shown raised levels of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)$\alpha$, interleukin (IL)-1$\beta$ and IL-6 in HF patients in plasma and circulating leukocytes, as well as in the failing myocardium itself. There is strong evidence that these mediators are involved in processes leading to cardiac remodeling such as hypertrophy, fibrosis and apoptosis. Some of these cytokines can also give useful prognostic information as reliable biomarkers in this disorder. In general, immunomodulating treatments have, with a few exceptions, been neutral or even harmful. However, the negative results of anti-TNF studies, for instance, do not necessarily argue against the 'cytokine hypothesis'. These studies just underscore the challenges in developing treatment modalities that can modulate the cytokine network in HF patients and result in beneficial net effects. Future studies should identify the crucial actors and their mechanisms of action in the immunopathogenesis of chronic HF and, in particular, clarify the balance between adaptive and maladaptive effects of these molecules. Such studies are a prerequisite for the development of new treatment strategies that target inflammatory and immunopathogenic mechanisms in HF. In this review article, these issues are thoroughly discussed, and we also argue for the possibility of future therapeutic targets such as mediators in innate immunity, chemokines and mediators in matrix remodeling.},

After previously reported variants in FTO, the strongest association signal (rs17782313, P = 2.9 x 10(-6)) mapped 188 kb downstream of MC4R (melanocortin-4 receptor), mutations of which are the leading cause of monogenic severe childhood-onset obesity. We confirmed the BMI association in 60,352 adults (per-allele effect = 0.05 Z-score units; P = 2.8 x 10(-15)) and 5,988 children aged 7-11 (0.13 Z-score units; P = 1.5 x 10(-8)). In case-control analyses (n = 10,583), the odds for severe childhood obesity reached 1.30 (P = 8.0 x 10(-11)). Furthermore, we observed overtransmission of the risk allele to obese offspring in 660 families (P (pedigree disequilibrium test average; PDT-avg) = 2.4 x 10(-4)). The SNP location and patterns of phenotypic associations are consistent with effects mediated through altered MC4R function. Our findings establish that common variants near MC4R influence fat mass, weight and obesity risk at the population level and reinforce the need for large-scale data integration to identify variants influencing continuous biomedical traits.},

abstract = {To efficiently transform genetic associations into drug targets requires evidence that a particular gene, and its encoded protein, contribute causally to a disease. To achieve this, we employ a three-step proteome-by-phenome Mendelian Randomization (MR) approach. In step one, 154 protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) were identified and independently replicated. From these pQTLs, 64 replicated locally-Acting variants were used as instrumental variables for proteome-by-phenome MR across 846 traits (step two). When its assumptions are met, proteome-by-phenome MR, is equivalent to simultaneously running many randomized controlled trials. Step 2 yielded 38 proteins that significantly predicted variation in traits and diseases in 509 instances. Step 3 revealed that amongst the 271 instances from GeneAtlas (UK Biobank), 77 showed little evidence of pleiotropy (HEIDI), and 92 evidence of colocalization (eCAVIAR). Results were wide ranging: including, for example, new evidence for a causal role of tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor type substrate 1 (SHPS1; SIRPA) in schizophrenia, and a new finding that intestinal fatty acid binding protein (FABP2) abundance contributes to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. We also demonstrated confirmatory evidence for the causal role of four further proteins (FGF5, IL6R, LPL, LTA) in cardiovascular disease risk.},

abstract = {The ultimate goal when treating high blood pressure is to reduce the incidence of end-organ damage and prevent cardiovascular disease, and thus reduce the incidence of premature death. Cuff blood pressure measurements have some prognostic value and have traditionally been used to predict the risk of end-organ damage. Such measurements, however, do not reflect accurately the 24-h mean blood pressure and hourly variations. For any value of cuff blood pressure, a lower 24-h mean blood pressure was associated with a lower prevalence and severity of end-organ damage. In the Pressioni Arteriose Monitorate E Loro Associazioni (PAMELA) study, data from 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) were more strongly associated with prognosis than other blood pressure data. Longitudinal evidence of the clinical relevance of 24-h ABPM data in predicting cardiovascular risk is less extensive. However, results from the Study on Ambulatory Monitoring of Pressure and Lisinopril Evaluation (SAMPLE) trial show the superiority of mean 24-h, daytime and night-time blood pressures over clinic readings in predicting the regression of left ventricular mass index in treated hypertensive patients. Furthermore, a direct, positive relationship has been established between 24-h blood pressure variability and the severity and rate of progression of end-organ damage. In addition, ABPM data demonstrate that hypertensive patients who do not exhibit a nocturnal reduction in blood pressure have a higher incidence of end-organ damage. Future directions for research and treatment of hypertension will need to consider the circadian cycle of blood pressure, the effect of treatment on blood pressure variability, and the magnitude of blood pressure changes in daily life.},

abstract = {Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) influences heart rate, coronary artery caliber, endothelial integrity, and lymphocyte recirculation through five related high affinity G-protein-coupled receptors. Inhibition of lymphocyte recirculation by non-selective S1P receptor agonists produces clinical immunosuppression preventing transplant rejection but is associated with transient bradycardia. Understanding the contribution of individual receptors has been limited by the embryonic lethality of the S1P(1) knock-out and the unavailability of selective agonists or antagonists. A potent, S1P(1)-receptor selective agonist structurally unrelated to S1P was found to activate multiple signals triggered by S1P, including guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate binding, calcium flux, Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, and stimulation of migration of S1P(1)- but not S1P(3)-expressing cells in vitro. The agonist also alters lymphocyte trafficking in vivo. Use of selective agonism together with deletant mice lacking S1P(3) receptor reveals that agonism of S1P(1) receptor alone is sufficient to control lymphocyte recirculation. Moreover, S1P(1) receptor agonist plasma levels are causally associated with induction and maintenance of lymphopenia. S1P(3), and not S1P(1), is directly implicated in sinus bradycardia. The sustained bradycardia induced by S1P receptor non-selective immunosuppressive agonists in wild-type mice is abolished in S1P(3)-/- mice, whereas S1P(1)-selective agonist does not produce bradycardia. Separation of receptor subtype usage for control of lymphocyte recirculation and heart rate may allow the identification of selective immunosuppressive S1P(1) receptor agonists with an enhanced therapeutic window. S1P(1)-selective agonists will be of broad utility in understanding cell functions in vitro, and vascular physiology in vivo, and the success of the chemical approach for S1P(1) suggests that selective tools for the resolution of function across this broad lipid receptor family are now possible.},

S1P promotes cell growth, survival and migration, and is a key regulator of lymphocyte trafficking. Inhibition of S1P signalling has been proposed as a strategy for treatment of inflammatory diseases and cancer. In the present paper we describe the discovery and characterization of PF-543, a novel cell-permeant inhibitor of SphK1. PF-543 inhibits SphK1 with a K(i) of 3.6 nM, is sphingosine-competitive and is more than 100-fold selective for SphK1 over the SphK2 isoform. In 1483 head and neck carcinoma cells, which are characterized by high levels of SphK1 expression and an unusually high rate of S1P production, PF-543 decreased the level of endogenous S1P 10-fold with a proportional increase in the level of sphingosine. In contrast with past reports that show that the growth of many cancer cell lines is SphK1-dependent, specific inhibition of SphK1 had no effect on the proliferation and survival of 1483 cells, despite a dramatic change in the cellular S1P/sphingosine ratio. PF-543 was effective as a potent inhibitor of S1P formation in whole blood, indicating that the SphK1 isoform of sphingosine kinase is the major source of S1P in human blood. PF-543 is the most potent inhibitor of SphK1 described to date and it will be useful for dissecting specific roles of SphK1-driven S1P signalling.},

abstract = {The sympathetic overdrive that characterizes essential hypertension is potentiated when left ventricular hypertrophy or congestive heart failure is detected. No information exists, however, on whether this is the case also for left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. In 17 untreated hypertensive subjects with left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (age: 47.7+/-2.9 years, mean+/-SEM), we measured sympathetic nerve traffic (microneurography), heart rate (ECG), and beat-to-beat arterial blood pressure (Finapres) at rest and during baroreceptor deactivation and stimulation. Data were compared with those collected in 20 age-matched normotensive and 20 hypertensive subjects without a diastolic function impairment. Muscle sympathetic nerve traffic values were markedly and significantly greater in the 2 hypertensive groups than in the normotensive one (55.3+/-1.2 and 71.2+/-1.6 versus 41.7+/-1.0 bursts per 100 heartbeats, respectively; P{\textless}0.01 for both). For a similar blood pressure elevation, however, the sympathetic nerve traffic increase was significantly greater in patients with than without left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (+28.9{\%}; P{\textless}0.05). In the population as a whole, muscle sympathetic nerve traffic was significantly and inversely related to various echocardiographic indices of diastolic function. Although baroreflex-heart rate control was significantly attenuated in the 2 hypertensive groups, baroreflex-sympathetic modulation was impaired only in those with diastolic dysfunction. These data provide the first evidence that, in hypertension, activation of the sympathetic nervous system may contribute not only at the blood pressure elevation but also at the development of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. The sympathetic overactivity, which is likely to be related to the baroreflex impairment, may account for the increased cardiovascular risk characterizing diastolic dysfunction.},

abstract = {Mendelian randomization, the use of genetic variants as instrumental variables (IV), can test for and estimate the causal effect of an exposure on an outcome. Most IV methods assume that the function relating the exposure to the expected value of the outcome (the exposure-outcome relationship) is linear. However, in practice, this assumption may not hold. Indeed, often the primary question of interest is to assess the shape of this relationship. We present two novel IV methods for investigating the shape of the exposure-outcome relationship: a fractional polynomial method and a piecewise linear method. We divide the population into strata using the exposure distribution, and estimate a causal effect, referred to as a localized average causal effect (LACE), in each stratum of population. The fractional polynomial method performs metaregression on these LACE estimates. The piecewise linear method estimates a continuous piecewise linear function, the gradient of which is the LACE estimate in each stratum. Both methods were demonstrated in a simulation study to estimate the true exposure-outcome relationship well, particularly when the relationship was a fractional polynomial (for the fractional polynomial method) or was piecewise linear (for the piecewise linear method). The methods were used to investigate the shape of relationship of body mass index with systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure.},

The occurrence of HRPR was increased among elderly patients with both clopidogrel and ticagrelor.|The aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact of age on platelet function and the occurrence of high residual on-treatment platelet reactivity (HRPR) in patients treated with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) using acetylsalicilic acid (ASA) and clopidogrel or ticagrelor.|Patients treated with DAPT (ASA and clopidogrel or ticagrelor) were scheduled for platelet function assessment at 30-90 days post-discharge. By whole blood impedance aggregometry, HRPR was considered for ASPI test values {\textgreater} 862 AU*min (for ASA) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) test values {\textgreater} 417 AU*min (for ADP antagonists). Elderly patients were defined as those aged ≥ 70 years.|Among 494 patients on DAPT, 224 (45.3{\%}) were ≥ 70 years old.

abstract = {Integrin $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 is a highly abundant heterodimeric platelet receptor that can transmit information bidirectionally across the plasma membrane, and plays a critical role in hemostasis and thrombosis. Upon platelet activation, inside-out signaling pathways increase the affinity of $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 for fibrinogen and other ligands. Ligand binding and integrin clustering subsequently stimulate outside-in signaling, which initiates and amplifies a range of cellular events driving essential platelet processes such as spreading, thrombus consolidation, and clot retraction. Integrin $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 has served as an excellent model for the study of integrin biology, and it has become clear that integrin outside-in signaling is highly complex and involves a vast array of enzymes, signaling adaptors, and cytoskeletal components. In this review, we provide a concise but comprehensive overview of $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 outside-in signaling, focusing on the key players involved, and how they cooperate to orchestrate this critical aspect of platelet biology. We also discuss gaps in the current understanding of $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 outside-in signaling and highlight avenues for future investigation.},

abstract = {We used radioligand binding techniques and measurement of beta-agonist-mediated positive inotropic responses in isolated cardiac tissue to examine beta-adrenergic-receptor subpopulations in nonfailing and failing human left and right ventricular myocardium. In tissue derived from 48 human hearts the receptor subtypes identified in nonfailing ventricle by radioligand binding were beta 1 (77{\%}) and beta 2 (23{\%}), with no evidence of an "atypical" beta-adrenergic receptor. In failing left ventricle the beta 1:beta 2 ratio was markedly different, i.e., 60:38. This decrease in the beta 1 proportion and increase in the beta 2 proportion in the failing ventricles were due to a 62{\%}, "selective" down-regulation of the beta 1 subpopulation, with little or no change in beta 2 receptors. In muscle bath experiments in isolated trabeculae derived from nonfailing and failing right ventricles, both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors were coupled to a positive inotropic response. In nonfailing myocardium, beta 1 responses predominated, as the selective beta 1 agonist denopamine produced a response that was 66{\%} of the total contractile response of isoproterenol. In heart failure the beta 1 component was markedly decreased, while the beta 2 component was not significantly diminished. Moreover, in heart failure the beta 2 component increased in prominence, as the contractile response to the selective beta 2 agonist zinterol increased from a minority (39{\%}) to a majority (60{\%}) of the total response generated by isoproterenol. We conclude that failing human ventricular myocardium contains a relatively high proportion of beta 2 receptors, due to selective down-regulation of beta 1 receptors. As a result, in the failing human heart the beta 2-receptor subpopulation is a relatively important mediator of inotropic support in response to nonselective beta-agonist stimulation and is available for inotropic stimulation by selective beta 2 agonists.},

abstract = {A higher body mass index (BMI) is a recognised risk factor for thrombosis. Platelets are essential for haemostasis but also contribute to thrombosis when activated pathologically. We hypothesised that an increase in BMI may lead to changes in platelet characteristics, thereby contributing to increased thrombotic risk.The effect of BMI on platelet traits measured by Sysmex XN-1000 was explored in 33388 UK blood donors from the INTERVAL study. Linear regression was used for observational analyses between BMI and platelet characteristics. Mendelian randomization (MR) was used to estimate a causal effect with BMI proxied by a genetic risk score. Follow-up analysis explored the relevance of platelet characteristics on whole blood platelet aggregation in a pre-operative cardiac cohort (COPTIC) using linear regression.Observationally, higher BMI was positively associated with greater plateletcrit (PCT), platelet count (PLT), immature platelet count (IPC) and side fluorescence (SFL, a measure of mRNA content used to derive IPC). MR provided causal estimates for a positive effect of BMI on both SFL and IPC (IPC 0.06 SDs higher per SD higher BMI, 95{\%} CI 0.006 to 0.12, P=0.03), but there was no strong evidence for a causal effect of BMI on PCT or PLT. The COPTIC study provided observational evidence for a positive association between IPC and whole blood platelet aggregation induced by adrenaline, TRAP-6 and ADP. Our results indicate that higher BMI raises the number of immature platelets, which is associated with greater whole blood platelet aggregation. Higher IPC could therefore contribute to obesity-related thrombosis.EssentialsA higher body mass index (BMI) is associated with thrombotic disorders.We explored whether BMI is associated with platelets traits, key cells involved in thrombosis.We found causal evidence for higher BMI raising immature platelet count (IPC).Higher IPC is associated with enhanced platelet aggregation in a cardiac surgery cohort.Competing Interest StatementPA is a full-time employee of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals.Funding StatementLJG is funded by the University of Bristol alumni on the 4-year BHF Integrative Cardiovascular Science PhD programme.

abstract = {Associations between modifiable exposures and disease seen in observational epidemiology are sometimes confounded and thus misleading, despite our best efforts to improve the design and analysis of studies. Mendelian randomization-the random assortment of genes from parents to offspring that occurs during gamete formation and conception-provides one method for assessing the causal nature of some environmental exposures. The association between a disease and a polymorphism that mimics the biological link between a proposed exposure and disease is not generally susceptible to the reverse causation or confounding that may distort interpretations of conventional observational studies. Several examples where the phenotypic effects of polymorphisms are well documented provide encouraging evidence of the explanatory power of Mendelian randomization and are described. The limitations of the approach include confounding by polymorphisms in linkage disequilibrium with the polymorphism under study, that polymorphisms may have several phenotypic effects associated with disease, the lack of suitable polymorphisms for studying modifiable exposures of interest, and canalization-the buffering of the effects of genetic variation during development. Nevertheless, Mendelian randomization provides new opportunities to test causality and demonstrates how investment in the human genome project may contribute to understanding and preventing the adverse effects on human health of modifiable exposures.},

abstract = {The prevalence of obesity has increased worldwide in the past {\~{}}50 years, reaching pandemic levels. Obesity represents a major health challenge because it substantially increases the risk of diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, fatty liver disease, hypertension, myocardial infarction, stroke, dementia, osteoarthritis, obstructive sleep apnoea and several cancers, thereby contributing to a decline in both quality of life and life expectancy. Obesity is also associated with unemployment, social disadvantages and reduced socio-economic productivity, thus increasingly creating an economic burden. Thus far, obesity prevention and treatment strategies - both at the individual and population level - have not been successful in the long term. Lifestyle and behavioural interventions aimed at reducing calorie intake and increasing energy expenditure have limited effectiveness because complex and persistent hormonal, metabolic and neurochemical adaptations defend against weight loss and promote weight regain. Reducing the obesity burden requires approaches that combine individual interventions with changes in the environment and society. Therefore, a better understanding of the remarkable regional differences in obesity prevalence and trends might help to identify societal causes of obesity and provide guidance on which are the most promising intervention strategies.},

The accumulated evidence is compelling for a primary role of the renal innervation in the pathogenesis of hypertension. These research discoveries led to the development of a catheter-based procedure for renal denervation in human subjects.

abstract = {Objective: This study aimed to investigate the role of cytokines as intermediates in the pathway from increased adiposity to disease. Methods: BMI and circulating levels of up to 41 cytokines were measured in individuals from three Finnish cohort studies (n = 8,293). Mendelian randomization (MR) was used to assess the impact of BMI on circulating cytokines and the impact of BMI-driven cytokines on risk of obesity-related diseases. Results: Observationally, BMI was associated with 19 cytokines. For every SD increase in BMI, causal effect estimates were strongest for hepatocyte growth factor, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), and tumor necrosis factor–related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and were as ratios of geometric means 1.13 (95{\%} CI: 1.08-1.19), 1.08 (95{\%} CI: 1.04-1.14), and 1.13 (95{\%} CI: 1.04-1.21), respectively. TRAIL was associated with a small increase in the odds of coronary artery disease (odds ratio: 1.03; 95{\%} CI: 1.00-1.06). There was inconsistent evidence for a protective role of MCP-1 against inflammatory bowel diseases. Conclusions: Observational and MR estimates of the effect of BMI on cytokine levels were generally concordant. There was little evidence for an effect of raised levels of BMI-driven cytokines on disease. These findings illustrate the challenges of MR when applied in the context of molecular mediation.},

abstract = {Steroid hormones are associated with the risk of postmenopausal breast cancer and evidence suggests that increased concentrations of oestrogens from peripheral aromatisation in adipose tissue partly explains the association between body mass index (BMI) and risk of postmenopausal breast cancer. This study examined the associations between circulating concentrations of steroid hormones and anthropometric measurements in a sample of naturally postmenopausal women from the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study, not using hormone replacement therapy. We measured plasma concentration of total oestradiol, oestrone sulphate, dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate, androstenedione, testosterone and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and calculated concentration of free oestradiol. Body measurements included height, weight, BMI, waist circumference, fat mass and fat-free mass, the last two estimated by bioelectrical impedance analysis. BMI was positively associated with both oestrogens and androgens and negatively with SHBG. Fat mass was the principal measure responsible for the association observed between body size and total oestradiol. The associations between oestrone sulphate and androgens and body size were mainly with waist circumference. The associations between oestrogens and body size were close to null for the first 6 years since menopause and became positive thereafter. Our results are compatible with the hypothesis that after the menopause excess fat mass increases oestrogen concentrations through the peripheral aromatisation of androgens in adipose tissue. This effect requires around 6 years to be detectable by way of circulating steroid hormone levels.},

abstract = {Platelet G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) regulate platelet function by mediating the response to various agonists, including adenosine diphosphate (ADP), thromboxane A2, and thrombin. Although GPCR kinases (GRKs) are considered to have the crucial roles in most GPCR functions, little is known regarding the regulation of GPCR signaling and mechanisms of GPCR desensitization by GRKs in platelets. In this study, we investigated the functional role of GRK6 and the molecular basis for regulation of specific GPCR desensitization by GRK6 in platelets. We used GRK6 knockout mice to evaluate the functional role of GRK6 in platelet activation. Platelet aggregation, dense-and $\alpha$-granule secretion, and fibrinogen receptor activation induced by 2-MeSADP, U46619, thrombin, and AYPGKF were significantly potentiated in GRK6−/− platelets compared to the wild-type (WT) platelets. However, collagen-related peptide (CRP)-induced platelet aggregation and secretion were not affected in GRK6−/− platelets. Interestingly, platelet aggregation induced by co-stimulation of serotonin and epinephrine which activate Gq-coupled 5HT2A and Gz-coupled 2A adrenergic receptors, respectively, was not affected in GRK6−/− platelets, suggesting that GRK6 was involved in specific GPCR regulation. In addition, platelet aggregation in response to the second challenge of ADP and AYPGKF was restored in GRK6−/− platelets whereas re-stimulation of the agonist failed to induce aggregation in WT platelets, indicating that GRK6 contributed to P2Y1, P2Y12, and PAR4 receptor desensitization. Furthermore, 2-MeSADP-induced Akt phosphorylation and AYPGKF‐-induced Akt, extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK), and protein kinase C$\delta$ (PKC) phosphorylation were significantly potentiated in GRK6−/− platelets. Finally, GRK6−/− mice exhibited an enhanced and stable thrombus formation after FeCl3 injury to the carotid artery and shorter tail bleeding times, indicating that GRK6−/− mice were more susceptible to thrombosis and hemostasis. We conclude that GRK6 plays an important role in regulating platelet functional responses and thrombus formation through selective GPCR desensitization.},

As human platelets possess c-Mp1-receptors and supraphysiological concentrations of TPO trigger platelet aggregation and secretion, we searched for the signalling pathways through which the c-Mp1-receptor might activate platelets. A physiological concentration of TPO (20 ng/mL) did not trigger platelet functions, but increased their sensitivity to alpha-thrombin resulting in a 4-fold faster dense granule secretion. The effect of TPO was abolished by indomethacin and caused by synergism with signal generation by alpha-thrombin at the level of the cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) pathway resulting in more arachidonate release, cPLA2 phosphorylation and thromboxane A2 formation. A similar synergism was seen at the level of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2 or p42-MAPK). These data suggest, that TPO increases the sensitivity of platelets to alpha-thrombin by enhancing cPLA2 activation via the ERK2-cPLA2 pathway.},

Leptin is a mediator of long-term regulation of energy balance, suppressing food intake and thereby inducing weight loss. Ghrelin on the other hand is a fast-acting hormone, seemingly playing a role in meal initiation. As a growing number of people suffer from obesity, understanding the mechanisms by which various hormones and neurotransmitters have influence on energy balance has been a subject of intensive research. In obese subjects the circulating level of the anorexigenic hormone leptin is increased, whereas surprisingly, the level of the orexigenic hormone ghrelin is decreased. It is now established that obese patients are leptin-resistant. However, the manner in which both the leptin and ghrelin systems contribute to the development or maintenance of obesity is as yet not clear. The purpose of this review is to provide background information on the leptin and ghrelin hormones, their role in food intake and body weight in humans, and their mechanism of action. Possible abnormalities in the leptin and ghrelin systems that may contribute to the development of obesity will be mentioned. In addition, the potentials of leptin and ghrelin as drug targets will be discussed. Finally, the influence of the diet on leptin and ghrelin secretion and functioning will be described.},

abstract = {Chronic heart failure (CHF) is often associated with excitation of the sympathetic nervous system. This event is thought to be a negative predictor of survival in CHF. Sympathoexcitation and central angiotensin II (Ang II) have been causally linked. Recent studies have shown that NAD(P)H oxidase-derived reactive oxidant species (ROS) are important mediators of Ang II signaling. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that central Ang II activates sympathetic outflow by stimulation of NAD(P)H oxidase and ROS in the CHF state. CHF was induced in male New Zealand White rabbits by chronic ventricular tachycardia. Using radio telemetry of arterial pressure and intracerebroventricular infusions, experiments were performed in the conscious state. Renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) was recorded as a direct measure of sympathetic outflow. Intracerebroventricular Ang II significantly increased RSNA in sham (131.5+/-13.3{\%} of control) and CHF (193.6+/-11.9{\%} of control) rabbits. The increase in CHF rabbits was significantly greater than in sham rabbits (P{\textless}0.01). These responses were abolished by intracerebroventricular losartan, tempol, or apocynin. Resting RSNA was significantly reduced by intracerebroventricular losartan, tempol, or apocynin in CHF rabbits but not in sham rabbits. Intracerebroventricular administration of the superoxide dismutase inhibitor diethyldithio-carbamic acid increased RSNA significantly more in sham compared with CHF rabbits. NADPH-dependent superoxide anion production in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) was increased by 2.9-fold in CHF rabbits compared with sham rabbits. Finally, increases in the RVLM mRNA and protein expression of Ang II type 1 (AT1) receptor and subunits of NAD(P)H oxidase (p40phox, p47phox, and gp91phox) were demonstrated in CHF rabbits. These data demonstrate intense radical stress in autonomic areas of the brain in experimental CHF and provide evidence for a tight relationship between Ang II and ROS as contributors to sympathoexcitation in CHF.},

Causal estimates using each instrument can be displayed visually by a funnel plot to assess potential asymmetry. Egger regression, a tool to detect small study bias in meta-analysis, can be adapted to test for bias from pleiotropy, and the slope coefficient from Egger regression provides an estimate of the causal effect. Under the assumption that the association of each genetic variant with the exposure is independent of the pleiotropic effect of the variant (not via the exposure), Egger's test gives a valid test of the null causal hypothesis and a consistent causal effect estimate even when all the genetic variants are invalid instrumental variables.|We illustrate the use of this approach by re-analysing two published Mendelian randomization studies of the causal effect of height on lung function, and the causal effect of blood pressure on coronary artery disease risk. The conservative nature of this approach is illustrated with these examples.|An adaption of Egger regression (which we call MR-Egger) can detect some violations of the standard instrumental variable assumptions, and provide an effect estimate which is not subject to these violations.

This impaired response was only observed in obese patients with the MS, and obese with the MS had significantly higher platelet reactivity than other obese patients with all regimens (p {\textless}0.01). Obese patients without the MS had no significant difference in platelet reactivity compared with nonobese patients. In conclusion, the present study confirmed that BMI has a strong impact on response to clopidogrel and prasugrel with higher incidence of high on-treatment platelet reactivity, lower incidence of low on-treatment platelet reactivity, and lower bleeding complication in obese patients. However, among obese patients, the presence of the MS strongly affects response to antiplatelet agents, indicating that the metabolic status might be a better predictor of platelet inhibition than BMI.},

abstract = {Thousands of genetic variants have been associated with complex traits through genome-wide association studies. However, the functional variants or mechanistic consequences remain elusive. Intermediate traits such as gene expression or protein levels are good proxies of the metabolic state of an organism. Proteome analysis especially can provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of complex traits like obesity. The role of genetic variation in determining protein level variation has not been assessed in obesity. To address this, we design a large-scale protein quantitative trait locus (pQTL) analysis based on a set of 1129 proteins from 494 obese subjects before and after a weight loss intervention. This reveals 55 BMI-associated cis-pQTLs and trans-pQTLs at baseline and 3 trans-pQTLs after the intervention. We provide evidence for distinct genetic mechanisms regulating BMI-associated proteins before and after weight loss. Finally, by functional analysis, we identify and validate FAM46A as a trans regulator for leptin.},

However, some patients are 'resistant' to antiplatelet therapy, which increases their risk of developing acute coronary syndromes. These patients often present with an underlying condition that is associated with altered levels of circulating platelet primers and platelet hyperactivity. Platelet primers cannot stimulate platelet activation, but, in combination with physiologic stimuli, significantly enhance platelet function.|To explore the role of platelet primers in resistance to antiplatelet therapy, and to evaluate whether phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) contributes to this process.|We used platelet aggregation, thromboxane A2 production and ex vivo thrombus formation as functional readouts of platelet activity. Platelets were treated with the potent P2Y12 inhibitor AR-C66096, aspirin, or a combination of both, in the presence or absence of the platelet primers insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and thrombopoietin (TPO), or the Gz-coupled receptor ligand epinephrine. We found that platelet primers largely overcame the inhibitory effects of antiplatelet compounds on platelet functional responses. IGF-1-mediated and TPO-mediated, but not epinephrine-mediated, enhancements in the presence of antiplatelet drugs were blocked by the PI3K inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002.|These results demonstrate that platelet primers can contribute to antiplatelet resistance. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that there are PI3K-dependent and PI3K-independent mechanisms driving primer-mediated resistance to antiplatelet therapy.},

Although the daytime systolic BP (SBP) was comparable in the two hypertensive groups, the nighttime SBP in patients with LVH tended to be higher than in patients without LVH (149.0 +/- 15.1 versus 138.4 +/- 20.1 mm Hg, p less than 0.10). The LV mass index correlated significantly with the nighttime SBP (r = 0.43, p less than 0.01), but not with the daytime SBP (r = 0.24, ns), with clinic SBP (r = 0.14, p = ns) or the SBP after handgrip exercise (r = 0.31, p = ns). The difference in the systolic BP between daytime and nighttime (D-N SBP) in patients with LVH (2.8 +/- 9.4 mm Hg) was significantly less than that in patients without LVH (12.8 +/- 16.0 mm Hg) (p less than 0.02). In addition, the D-N SBP correlated inversely with the left ventricular mass index (r = -0.33, p less than 0.05).

We first identified associations between the three RBC components: mean platelet volume (MPV), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and platelet counts (PC), and the genotypes of approximately 500,000 SNPs on the Illumina Infimum DNA Human OmniExpress-24 BeadChip using a single cohort of 4,673 Northern Nevadans. Twenty-one SNPs in five major genomic regions were found to be statistically significantly associated with MPV, two regions with MCV, and one region with PC, with p{\textless}5x10-8. Twenty-nine SNPs and nine chromosomal regions were identified in 30 previous GWASs, with effect sizes of similar magnitude and direction as found in our cohort. The two strongest associations were SNP rs1354034 with MPV (p = 2.4x10-13) and rs855791 with MCV (p = 5.2x10-12). We then examined possible associations between these significant SNPs and incidence of 1,488 phenotype groups mapped from International Classification of Disease version 9 and 10 (ICD9 and ICD10) codes collected in the extensive electronic health record (EHR) database associated with Healthy Nevada Project consented participants. Further leveraging data collected in the EHR, we performed an additional PheWAS to identify associations between continuous red blood cell (RBC) component measures and incidence of specific diagnoses. The first PheWAS illuminated whether SNPs associated with RBC components in our cohort were linked with other hematologic phenotypic diagnoses or diagnoses of other nature. Although no SNPs from our GWAS were identified as strongly associated to other phenotypic components, a number of associations were identified with p-values ranging between 1x10-3 and 1x10-4 with traits such as respiratory failure, sleep disorders, hypoglycemia, hyperglyceridemia, GERD and IBS. The second PheWAS examined possible phenotypic predictors of abnormal RBC component measures: a number of hematologic phenotypes such as thrombocytopenia, anemias, hemoglobinopathies and pancytopenia were found to be strongly associated to RBC component measures; additional phenotypes such as (morbid) obesity, malaise and fatigue, alcoholism, and cirrhosis were also identified to be possible predictors of RBC component measures.},

Many proteins have been linked to complex disorders and are also under substantial genetic control. Here, we investigate the associations between over 1000 blood circulating proteins and body mass index (BMI) in three studies including over 4600 participants. We show that BMI is associated with widespread changes in the plasma proteome. We observe 152 replicated protein associations with BMI. 24 proteins also associate with a genome-wide polygenic score (GPS) for BMI. These proteins are involved in lipid metabolism and inflammatory pathways impacting clinically relevant pathways of adiposity. Mendelian randomization suggests a bi-directional causal relationship of BMI with LEPR/LEP, IGFBP1, and WFIKKN2, a protein-to-BMI relationship for AGER, DPT, and CTSA, and a BMI-to-protein relationship for another 21 proteins. Combined with animal model and tissue-specific gene expression data, our findings suggest potential therapeutic targets further elucidating the role of these proteins in obesity associated pathologies.},

Excessive production of cytokines by microglia, however, may cause long-lasting behavioral and cognitive complications. The purpose of this study was to determine if minocycline, an anti-inflammatory agent and purported microglial inhibitor, attenuates lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation, sickness behavior, and anhedonia.|In the first set of experiments the effect of minocycline pretreatment on LPS-induced microglia activation was assessed in BV-2 microglia cell cultures. In the second study, adult (3-6 m) BALB/c mice received an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of vehicle or minocycline (50 mg/kg) for three consecutive days. On the third day, mice were also injected (i.p.) with saline or Escherichia coli LPS (0.33 mg/kg) and behavior (i.e., sickness and anhedonia) and markers of neuroinflammation (i.e., microglia activation and inflammatory cytokines) were determined. In the final study, adult and aged BALB/c mice were treated with the same minocycline and LPS injection regimen and markers of neuroinflammation were determined. All data were analyzed using Statistical Analysis Systems General Linear Model procedures and were subjected to one-, two-, or three-way ANOVA to determine significant main effects and interactions.|Minocycline blocked LPS-stimulated inflammatory cytokine secretion in the BV-2 microglia-derived cell line and reduced LPS-induced Toll-like-receptor-2 (TLR2) surface expression on brain microglia. Moreover, minocycline facilitated the recovery from sickness behavior (i.e., anorexia, weight loss, and social withdrawal) and prevented anhedonia in adult mice challenged with LPS. Furthermore, the minocycline associated recovery from LPS-induced sickness behavior was paralleled by reduced mRNA levels of Interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, and indoleamine 2, 3 dioxygenase (IDO) in the cortex and hippocampus. Finally, in aged mice, where exaggerated neuroinflammation was elicited by LPS, minocycline pretreatment was still effective in markedly reducing mRNA levels of IL-1beta, TLR2 and IDO in the hippocampus.|These data indicate that minocycline mitigates neuroinflammation in the adult and aged brain and modulates the cytokine-associated changes in motivation and behavior.},

BP variability was depicted as standard deviation, coefficient of variation, and deviation from age-predicted values using 6-15 serial BP measurements from childhood to adulthood over an average of 25.7 years. Birth weight was significantly and negatively associated with adulthood BP levels, long-term BP levels, and rate of change. Importantly, low birth weight was significantly associated with increased BP variability in terms of standard deviation, coefficient of variation, and deviation. As evaluated using the regression coefficients, a 1-kg lower birth weight was associated with increases in systolic BP variability measures (-0.38 mm Hg, P = 0.04 for standard deviation; -0.004 mm Hg, P = 0.01 for coefficient of variation; and -0.16 mm Hg, P = 0.04 for deviation) after adjustment for race, age, sex, mean BP levels, and gestational age; similar trends in the associations were noted for diastolic BP variability measures. In conclusion, these findings suggest that birth weight affects not only BP levels but also the magnitude of within-individual BP fluctuations over time through fetal programming in BP regulation mechanisms.},

In particular, we were interested in how often the relative wall thickness (RWT) was abnormal in patients with normal LV mass index (LVMI). As both abnormal RWT and LVMI indicate altered LV remodeling, the secondary objective of this research was to study whether a significant number of patients would be missing the diagnosis of LV remodeling if the RWT is not measured.All patients were referred within 48 hours after a stroke or a TIA for a clinically indicated transthoracic echocardiogram.

Mean age was 63.7 ± 12.5 years, 64.4{\%} men. Concentric remodeling carried the highest frequency, 49.2{\%}, followed by concentric hypertrophy, 30.7{\%}, normal pattern, 15.5{\%}, and eccentric hypertrophy, 4.1{\%}.

While newer antiplatelet agents have now become available, clopidogrel is still widely used due to its low cost and efficacy. However, many patients still experience recurrent ischemic events. A poor response of the platelets to clopidogrel, called High Residual Platelet Reactivity (HRPR), has been incriminated to account for this dilemma. Despite the absence of a universal definition of HRPR or the gold standard test to quantify it, persistent high platelet reactivity has consistently been associated with recurrence of ischemic events. Clopidogrel metabolism is highly variable, and genetics, comorbidities and drug interactions can affect it. In this article we review all definitions of HRPR, explore the available tests to quantify it, the clinical outcomes associated with it, as well as strategies that have shown success in overcoming it.},

abstract = {Numerous studies addressed the predictive value of the nighttime blood pressure (BP) as captured by ambulatory monitoring. However, arbitrary cutoff limits in dichotomized analyses of continuous variables, data dredging across selected subgroups, extrapolation of cross-sectional studies to prospective outcomes, and lack of comprehensive adjustments for confounders make interpretation of the literature difficult. We reviewed prospective studies with total mortality or a composite cardiovascular end point as an outcome in relation to the level and the circadian profile of systolic BP. We analyzed studies in hypertensive patients (n = 23 856) separately from those in individuals randomly recruited from populations (n = 9641). We pooled summary statistics and individual subject data, respectively. In both patients and populations, in analyses in which nighttime BP was additionally adjusted for daytime BP and vice versa, nighttime BP was a stronger predictor than daytime BP. With adjustment for the 24-hour BP, both the night-to-day BP ratio and dipping status remained significant predictors of outcome but added little prognostic value over and beyond the 24-hour BP level. In the absence of conclusive evidence proving that nondipping is a reversible risk factor, the option whether or not to restore the diurnal blood pressure profile to a normal pattern should be left to the clinical judgment of doctors and should be individualized for each patient. Current guidelines on the interpretation of ambulatory BP recording need to be updated.},

It reflects both health and nutritional status and predicts performance, health, and survival. As such, it is a valuable, but currently underused, tool for guiding public health policy and clinical decisions. This report presents the conclusions and comprehensive recommendations of a WHO Expert Committee for the present and future uses and interpretation of anthropometry. In a section that sets the technical framework for the report, the significance of anthropometric indicators and indices is explained and the principles of applied biostatistics and epidemiology that underlie their various uses are discussed. Subsequent sections provide detailed guidance on the use and interpretation of anthropometric measurements in pregnant and lactating women, newborn infants, infants and children, adolescents, overweight and thin adults, and adults aged 60 years and over. With a similar format for each section, the report assesses specific applications of anthropometry in individuals and populations for purposes of screening and for targeting and evaluating interventions. Advice on data management and analysis is offered, and methods of taking particular measurements are described. Each section also includes a discussion of the extent, reliability and universal relevance of existing reference data. An extensive series of reference data recommended by the Expert Committee and not widely distributed by WHO hitherto is included in an annex.},

abstract = {When missing data occur in one or more covariates in a regression model, multiple imputation (MI) is widely advocated as an improvement over complete-case analysis (CC). We use theoretical arguments and simulation studies to compare these methods with MI implemented under a missing at random assumption. When data are missing completely at random, both methods have negligible bias, and MI is more efficient than CC across a wide range of scenarios. For other missing data mechanisms, bias arises in one or both methods. In our simulation setting, CC is biased towards the null when data are missing at random. However, when missingness is independent of the outcome given the covariates, CC has negligible bias and MI is biased away from the null. With more general missing data mechanisms, bias tends to be smaller for MI than for CC. Since MI is not always better than CC for missing covariate problems, the choice of method should take into account what is known about the missing data mechanism in a particular substantive application. Importantly, the choice of method should not be based on comparison of standard errors. We propose new ways to understand empirical differences between MI and CC, which may provide insights into the appropriateness of the assumptions underlying each method, and we propose a new index for assessing the likely gain in precision from MI: the fraction of incomplete cases among the observed values of a covariate (FICO).},

abstract = {Minocycline is a semi-synthetic, second-generation tetracycline. It was introduced in 1972 and has both antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. Minocycline is used for a variety of infectious diseases and in acne. Even today, new indications beyond the antibacterial indications are being investigated such as its use in neurologic diseases. Formerly, minocycline was thought to have a superior efficacy in the treatment of inflammatory acne, especially with respect to antibacterial-resistant Propionibacterium acnes. A thorough review of the literature, however, shows that minocycline is not more effective in acne than other tetracyclines. Compared with first-generation tetracyclines, minocycline has a better pharmacokinetic profile, and compared with doxycycline it is not phototoxic. However, minocycline has an increased risk of severe adverse effects compared with other tetracyclines. It may induce hypersensitivity reactions affecting the liver, lung, kidneys, or multiple organs (Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms [DRESS] syndrome) in the first weeks of treatment and, with long-term treatment, may cause autoimmune reactions (systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune hepatitis). In addition, CNS symptoms, such as dizziness, are more frequent compared with other tetracyclines. Long-term treatment may induce hyperpigmentation of the skin or other organs. Resistance of P. acnes to minocycline also occurs, dependent on the prescribing behavior. Considering the aspects of efficacy, its adverse effect profile, resistance, price, and alternatives, minocycline is no longer considered the first-line antibacterial in the treatment of acne.},

abstract = {The expression of proinflammatory cytokines increases in the hypothalamus of rats with heart failure (HF). The pathophysiological significance of this observation is unknown. We hypothesized that hypothalamic proinflammatory cytokines upregulate the activity of central neural systems that contribute to increased sympathetic nerve activity in HF, specifically, the brain renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Rats with HF induced by coronary ligation and sham-operated controls (SHAM) were treated for 4 wk with a continuous intracerebroventricular infusion of the cytokine synthesis inhibitor pentoxifylline (PTX, 10 microg/h) or artificial cerebrospinal fluid (VEH). In VEH-treated HF rats, compared with VEH-treated SHAM rats, the hypothalamic expression of proinflammatory cytokines was increased, along with key components of the brain RAS (renin, angiotensin-converting enzyme, angiotensin type 1 receptor) and corticotropin-releasing hormone, the central indicator of HPA axis activation, in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus. The expression of other inflammatory/excitatory mediators (superoxide, prostaglandin E(2)) was also increased, along with evidence of chronic neuronal excitation in PVN. VEH-treated HF rats had higher plasma levels of norepinephrine, ANG II, interleukin (IL)-1beta, and adrenocorticotropic hormone, increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, and increased wet lung-to-body weight ratio. With the exception of plasma IL-1beta, an indicator of peripheral proinflammatory cytokine activity, all measures of neurohumoral excitation were significantly lower in HF rats treated with intracerebroventricular PTX. These findings suggest that the increase in brain proinflammatory cytokines observed in rats with ischemia-induced HF is functionally significant, contributing to neurohumoral excitation by activating brain RAS and the HPA axis.},

Patients present with clinical features distinct from BWCFF, including mild developmental disability, microcephaly, and thrombocytopenia with platelet anisotropy. Using patient-derived fibroblasts, we demonstrate cohort specific changes to $\beta$-CYA filament populations, which include the enhanced recruitment of thrombocytopenia-associated actin binding proteins (ABPs). These perturbed interactions are supported by in silico modeling and are validated in disease-relevant thrombocytes. Co-examination of actin and microtubule cytoskeleton constituents in patient-derived megakaryocytes and thrombocytes indicates that these $\beta$-CYA mutations inhibit the final stages of platelet maturation by compromising microtubule organization. Our results define an ACTB-associated clinical syndrome with a distinct genotype-phenotype correlation and delineate molecular mechanisms underlying thrombocytopenia in this patient cohort.},

abstract = {Disturbances in cardiovascular neural regulation, influencing both disease course and survival, progress as heart failure worsens. Heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction has long been considered a state of generalized sympathetic activation, itself a reflex response to alterations in cardiac and peripheral hemodynamics that is initially appropriate, but ultimately pathological. Because arterial baroreceptor reflex vagal control of heart rate is impaired early in heart failure, a parallel reduction in its reflex buffering of sympathetic outflow has been assumed. However, it is now recognized that: 1) the time course and magnitude of sympathetic activation are target organ-specific, not generalized, and independent of ventricular systolic function; and 2) human heart failure is characterized by rapidly responsive arterial baroreflex regulation of muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA), attenuated cardiopulmonary reflex modulation of MSNA, a cardiac sympathoexcitatory reflex related to increased cardiopulmonary filling pressure, and by individual variation in nonbaroreflex-mediated sympathoexcitatory mechanisms, including coexisting sleep apnea, myocardial ischemia, obesity, and reflexes from exercising muscle. Thus, sympathetic activation in the setting of impaired systolic function reflects the net balance and interaction between appropriate reflex compensatory responses to impaired systolic function and excitatory stimuli that elicit adrenergic responses in excess of homeostatic requirements. Recent observations have been incorporated into an updated model of cardiovascular neural regulation in chronic heart failure due to ventricular systolic dysfunction, with implications for the clinical evaluation of patients, application of current treatment, and development of new therapies.},

abstract = {Background: The Sysmex XN haematology instrument performs automatic reflex testing, depending on sample results. A nucleated red blood cell (NRBC) count is provided on all samples. The instrument has a smaller footprint (34{\%}) than previous Sysmex XE analysers. Methods: An evaluation comparing all results to the Sysmex XE-2100 and manual microscopic differential and morphology (n=390) was performed followed by a workflow study of 1000 samples to compare speed of operation and number of blood films reviews required from both systems. Results: The new features on the instrument are: (1) white cell and NRBC channel, all samples include the NRBC count; (2) white cell precursor channel: false positive flags for blasts, abnormal lymphocytes and atypical lymphocytes are reduced significantly without a statistical increase of false negatives; (3) low white cell count mode: suggested setting of {\textless}0.5×109/l. An extended count is more precise and provides an accurate differential. Fluorescent platelet count is performed in a dedicated channel. If the red cell or platelet size histograms are abnormal or if the platelet count is low, then a fluorescent platelet count is automatically performed. Good correlation with the XE-2100 and manual differential was found and the improved results compared to the reference flow cytometric analysis for platelet counts, especially below 30×109/l (XE-2100, R2=0.500; XN, R 2=0.875). Conclusion: The XN showed reduced sample turnaround time of 10{\%} and reduced number of blood films for examination, 49{\%} less than the XE-2100 without loss of sensitivity with more precise and accurate results on low cell counts.},

abstract = {Adipose tissue expresses tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin (IL)-6, which may cause obesity-related insulin resistance. We measured TNF and IL-6 expression in the adipose tissue of 50 lean and obese subjects without diabetes. Insulin sensitivity (SI) was determined by an intravenous glucose tolerance test with minimal-model analysis. When lean [body mass index (BMI) {\textless}25 kg/m2] and obese (BMI 30-40 kg/m2) subjects were compared, there was a 7.5-fold increase in TNF secretion (P {\textless} 0.05) from adipose tissue, and the TNF secretion was inversely related to SI (r = -0.42, P {\textless} 0.02). IL-6 was abundantly expressed by adipose tissue. In contrast to TNF, plasma (rather than adipose) IL-6 demonstrated the strongest relationship with obesity and insulin resistance. Plasma IL-6 was significantly higher in obese subjects and demonstrated a highly significant inverse relationship with SI (r = -0.71, P {\textless} 0.001). To separate the effects of BMI from SI, subjects who were discordant for SI were matched for BMI, age, and gender. By use of this approach, subjects with low SI demonstrated a 3.0-fold increased level of TNF secretion from adipose tissue and a 2.3-fold higher plasma IL-6 level (P {\textless} 0.05) compared with matched subjects with a high SI. Plasma IL-6 was significantly associated with plasma nonesterified fatty acid levels (r = 0.49, P {\textless} 0.002). Thus the local expression of TNF and plasma IL-6 are higher in subjects with obesity-related insulin resistance.},

Mothers' data was taken from the original study, and cardiovascular measures at the visit prior to pregnancy were correlated with daughter's measures. Maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, skinfold, and waist circumference were examined as a predictor of daughters' blood pressure, lipids, and glucose, as well as a predictor of birthweight and gestational age of grandchildren. Maternal pre-pregnancy BMI was associated with higher blood pressure and lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and cholesterol in the daughters. Most maternal cardiometabolic risk factors were not associated with grandchildren's birth outcomes, even though higher cholesterol and LDL was associated with lower gestational age, and higher BMI and skinfold thickness with an increased risk of preterm birth. In this pilot study, some associations were found between maternal adiposity and cardiovascular risk, daughters' cardiovascular risk, and grandchild birth outcomes. Lack of conclusive associations could be due to a true lack of effect, effects being primarily mediated through daughter's BMI, or the low power of the study.},

abstract = {Integrin $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 is a member of the integrin family of transmembrane proteins present on the plasma membrane of platelets. Integrin $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 is widely known to regulate the process of thrombosis via activation at its cytoplasmic side by talin and interaction with the soluble fibrinogen. It is also reported that three groups of interactions restrain integrin family members in the inactive state, including a set of salt bridges on the cytoplasmic side of the transmembrane domain of the integrin $\alpha$- and $\beta$-subunits known as the inner membrane clasp, hydrophobic packing of a few transmembrane residues on the extracellular side between the $\alpha$- and $\beta$-subunits that is known as the outer membrane clasp, and the key interaction group of the $\beta$A domain (located on the $\beta$-subunit head domain) with the $\beta$TD (proximal to the plasma membrane on the $\beta$-subunit). However, molecular details of this key interaction group as well as events that lead to detachment of the $\beta$TD and $\beta$A domains have remained ambiguous. In this study, we use molecular dynamics models to take a comprehensive outside-in and inside-out approach at exploring how integrin $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 is activated. First, we show that talin's interaction with the membrane-proximal and membrane-distal regions of integrin cytoplasmic- transmembrane domains significantly loosens the inner membrane clasp. Talin also interacts with an additional salt bridge (R734-E1006), which facilitates integrin activation through the separation of the integrin's $\alpha$- and $\beta$-subunits. The second part of our study classifies three types of interactions between RGD peptides and the extracellular domains of integrin $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3. Finally, we show that the interaction of the Arg of the RGD sequence may activate integrin via disrupting the key interaction group between K350 on the $\beta$A domain and S673/S674 on the $\beta$TD. {\textcopyright} 2013 Biophysical Society.},

Strong residual relations of left ventricular mass/body surface area to body surface area (r = 0.54) and of ventricular mass/height to height (r = 0.72) were markedly reduced by normalization of ventricular mass for height2.7 and body surface area1.5.

These problems are avoided and variability among normal subjects is reduced by using left ventricular mass/height2.7.

abstract = {The associations of blood pressure with the different manifestations of incident cardiovascular disease in a contemporary population have not been compared. In this study, we aimed to analyse the associations of blood pressure with 12 different presentations of cardiovascular disease.|We used linked electronic health records from 1997 to 2010 in the CALIBER (CArdiovascular research using LInked Bespoke studies and Electronic health Records) programme to assemble a cohort of 1{\textperiodcentered}25 million patients, 30 years of age or older and initially free from cardiovascular disease, a fifth of whom received blood pressure-lowering treatments. We studied the heterogeneity in the age-specific associations of clinically measured blood pressure with 12 acute and chronic cardiovascular diseases, and estimated the lifetime risks (up to 95 years of age) and cardiovascular disease-free life-years lost adjusted for other risk factors at index ages 30, 60, and 80 years. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01164371.|During 5{\textperiodcentered}2 years median follow-up, we recorded 83,098 initial cardiovascular disease presentations. In each age group, the lowest risk for cardiovascular disease was in people with systolic blood pressure of 90-114 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure of 60-74 mm Hg, with no evidence of a J-shaped increased risk at lower blood pressures. The effect of high blood pressure varied by cardiovascular disease endpoint, from strongly positive to no effect. Associations with high systolic blood pressure were strongest for intracerebral haemorrhage (hazard ratio 1{\textperiodcentered}44 [95{\%} CI 1{\textperiodcentered}32-1{\textperiodcentered}58]), subarachnoid haemorrhage (1{\textperiodcentered}43 [1{\textperiodcentered}25-1{\textperiodcentered}63]), and stable angina (1{\textperiodcentered}41 [1{\textperiodcentered}36-1{\textperiodcentered}46]), and weakest for abdominal aortic aneurysm (1{\textperiodcentered}08 [1{\textperiodcentered}00-1{\textperiodcentered}17]). Compared with diastolic blood pressure, raised systolic blood pressure had a greater effect on angina, myocardial infarction, and peripheral arterial disease, whereas raised diastolic blood pressure had a greater effect on abdominal aortic aneurysm than did raised systolic pressure. Pulse pressure associations were inverse for abdominal aortic aneurysm (HR per 10 mm Hg 0{\textperiodcentered}91 [95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}86-0{\textperiodcentered}98]) and strongest for peripheral arterial disease (1{\textperiodcentered}23 [1{\textperiodcentered}20-1{\textperiodcentered}27]). People with hypertension (blood pressure ≥140/90 mm Hg or those receiving blood pressure-lowering drugs) had a lifetime risk of overall cardiovascular disease at 30 years of age of 63{\textperiodcentered}3{\%} (95{\%} CI 62{\textperiodcentered}9-63{\textperiodcentered}8) compared with 46{\textperiodcentered}1{\%} (45{\textperiodcentered}5-46{\textperiodcentered}8) for those with normal blood pressure, and developed cardiovascular disease 5{\textperiodcentered}0 years earlier (95{\%} CI 4{\textperiodcentered}8-5{\textperiodcentered}2). Stable and unstable angina accounted for most (43{\%}) of the cardiovascular disease-free years of life lost associated with hypertension from index age 30 years, whereas heart failure and stable angina accounted for the largest proportion (19{\%} each) of years of life lost from index age 80 years.|The widely held assumptions that blood pressure has strong associations with the occurrence of all cardiovascular diseases across a wide age range, and that diastolic and systolic associations are concordant, are not supported by the findings of this high-resolution study. Despite modern treatments, the lifetime burden of hypertension is substantial. These findings emphasise the need for new blood pressure-lowering strategies, and will help to inform the design of randomised trials to assess them.|Medical Research Council, National Institute for Health Research, and Wellcome Trust.},

abstract = {The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is expected to increase rapidly in the next decades, posing a major challenge to societies worldwide. The emerging era of precision medicine calls for the discovery of biomarkers of clinical value for prediction of disease onset, where causal biomarkers can furthermore provide actionable targets. Blood-based factors like serum proteins are in contact with every organ in the body to mediate global homeostasis and may thus directly regulate complex processes such as aging and the development of common chronic diseases. We applied a data-driven proteomics approach measuring serum levels of 4,137 proteins in 5,438 Icelanders to discover novel biomarkers for incident T2DM and describe the serum protein profile of prevalent T2DM. We identified 536 proteins associated with incident or prevalent T2DM. Through LASSO penalized logistic regression analysis combined with bootstrap resampling, a panel of 20 protein biomarkers that accurately predicted incident T2DM was identified with a significant incremental improvement over traditional risk factors. Finally, a Mendelian randomization analysis provided support for a causal role of 48 proteins in the development of T2DM, which could be of particular interest as novel therapeutic targets.},

abstract = {Background: Epidemiologic studies examining circulating levels of inflammatory markers in relation to obesity and physical inactivity may aid in our understanding of the role of inflammation in obesity-related cancers. However, previous studies on this topic have focused on a limited set of markers.
Methods: We evaluated associations between body mass index (BMI) and vigorous physical activity level, based on self-report, and serum levels of 78 inflammation-related markers. Markers were measured using a bead-based multiplex method among 1,703 men and women, ages 55-74 years, and with no prior history of cancer at blood draw, and selected for case-control studies nested within the Prostate, Lung, Ovarian, and Colorectal Cancer Screening Trial. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, smoking, case-control study, physical activity, and BMI.
Results: Twelve markers were positively associated with BMI after FDR correction. ORs and 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) for highest versus lowest levels of CCL2/MCP-1, CXCL5/ENA-78, sTNFRII, CXCL10/IP-10, CXCL6/GCP2, CCL13/MCP-4, amylin, CRP, C-peptide, CCL19/MIP-3b, insulin, and leptin were: 1.50 (1.14-1.98), 1.52 (1.12-2.05), 1.61 (1.17-2.20), 1.69 (1.25-2.28), 1.74 (1.24-2.44), 1.75 (1.22-2.50), 1.91 (1.31-2.78), 2.41 (1.36-4.25), 2.78 (1.83-4.24), 3.30 (2.28-4.78), 4.05 (2.51-6.55), and 50.03 (19.87-125.99) per 5 kg/m2, respectively. Only CXCL12/SDF-1a was associated with physical activity (≥3 vs. {\textless}1 h/wk; OR, 3.28; 95{\%} CI, 1.55-6.94) after FDR correction.
Conclusions: BMI was associated with a wide range of circulating markers involved in the inflammatory response.
Impact: This cross-sectional analysis identified serum markers could be considered in future studies aimed at understanding the underlying mechanisms linking inflammation with obesity and obesity-related cancers.},

abstract = {Clinical and epidemiological studies support a connection between obesity and thrombosis, involving elevated expression of the prothrombotic molecules plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and tissue factor (TF) and increased platelet activation. Cardiovascular diseases and metabolic syndrome-associated disorders, including obesity, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and hepatic steatosis, involve inflammation elicited by infiltration and activation of immune cells, particularly macrophages, into adipose tissue. Although TF has been clearly linked to a procoagulant state in obesity, emerging genetic and pharmacologic evidence indicate that TF signaling via G protein-coupled protease-activated receptors (PAR2, PAR1) additionally drives multiple aspects of the metabolic syndrome. TF-PAR2 signaling in adipocytes contributes to diet-induced obesity by decreasing metabolism and energy expenditure, whereas TF-PAR2 signaling in hematopoietic and myeloid cells drives adipose tissue inflammation, hepatic steatosis, and insulin resistance. TF-initiated coagulation leading to thrombin-PAR1 signaling also contributes to diet-induced hepatic steatosis and inflammation in certain models. Thus, in obese patients, clinical markers of a prothrombotic state may indicate a risk for the development of complications of the metabolic syndrome. Furthermore, TF-induced signaling could provide new therapeutic targets for drug development at the intersection between obesity, inflammation, and thrombosis.},

Data on the influence of obesity on clopidogrel-mediated platelet inhibition are conflicting and limited to platelet function tests. Moreover, there are no data on thrombin-inducible platelet activation in obese patients. We therefore investigated response to clopidogrel therapy and protease activated receptor (PAR)-1 mediated platelet activation in obese and nonobese patients undergoing angioplasty and stenting for cardiovascular disease. The vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) phosphorylation assay, multiple electrode aggregometry (MEA) with adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and surface expressions of P-selectin and activated glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa in response to ADP and thrombin receptor activating peptide (TRAP)-6 were assessed in 71 obese and 245 nonobese patients. Obesity was independently associated with higher residual platelet reactivity by the VASP assay and MEA ADP, and with platelet surface expressions of P-selectin and activated GPIIb/IIIa in response to ADP (all P ≤ 0.04). Further, high on-treatment residual ADP-inducible platelet reactivity by the VASP assay and by MEA ADP were significantly more frequent in obese patients compared with nonobese patients (both P ≤ 0.04). Finally, PAR-1 mediated platelet activation as assessed by expression of P-selectin and activated GPIIb/IIIa in response to TRAP-6 was significantly more pronounced in obese patients than in patients without obesity (both P ≤ 0.02). In conclusion, obese patients undergoing angioplasty and stenting exhibit a diminished response to clopidogrel and an increased susceptibility to TRAP-6 inducible platelet activation.},

Saturable transport systems from blood to the CNS have been described for interleukin (IL)-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Blood-borne cytokines have been shown to cross the BBB to enter cerebrospinal fluid and interstitial fluid spaces of the brain and spinal cord. IL-2 does not cross the BBB by a saturable transport system. The blood-to-brain uptakes of IL-1 alpha, IL-beta, and IL-1ra are interrelated for most brain sites, but the posterior division of the septum shows selective uptake of blood-borne IL-1 alpha. The saturable transport systems for IL-6 and TNF-alpha are distinguishable from each other and from the IL-1 systems. The amount of blood-borne cytokines entering the brain is modest but comparable to that of other water-soluble compounds, such as morphine, known to cross the BBB in sufficient amounts to affect brain function. CNS to blood efflux of cytokines has also been shown to occur, but the mechanism of passage is unclear. Taken together, the evidence shows that passage of cytokines across the BBB occurs, providing a route by which blood-borne cytokines could potentially affect brain function.},

abstract = {Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) levels are significantly higher in blood and lymph than in tissues. This S1P concentration difference is necessary for proper lymphocyte egress from secondary lymphoid tissue and to maintain endothelial barrier integrity. Studies with mice lacking either sphingosine kinase (SphK) type 1 and 2 indicate that these enzymes are the sole biosynthetic source of S1P, but they play different roles in setting S1P blood levels. We have developed a set of drug-like SphK inhibitors, with differing selectivity for the two isoforms of this enzyme. Although all SphK inhibitors tested decrease S1P when applied to cultured U937 cells, only those inhibitors with a bias for SphK2 drove a substantial increase in blood S1P in mice and this rise was detectable within minutes of administration of the inhibitor. Blood S1P also increased in response to SphK2 inhibitors in rats. Mass-labeled S1P was cleared more slowly after intravenous injection into SphK2 inhibitor-treated mice or mice lacking a functional SphK2 gene; thus, the increased accumulation of S1P in the blood appears to result from the decreased clearance of S1P from the blood. Therefore, SphK2 appears to have a function independent of generating S1P in cells. Our results suggest that differential SphK inhibition with a drug might afford a method to manipulate blood S1P levels in either direction while lowering tissue S1P levels.},

abstract = {Understanding the increasingly complex role of chemokines in various manifestations of atherosclerotic vascular disease and the apparent redundancy in their expression requires improved concepts defining the specialization and cooperation of chemokines in regulating the recruitment of mononuclear cells to vascular lesions. In an attempt to elaborate such models, this review highlights recent insights into the functional role of chemokines in mediating distinct steps during the atherogenic recruitment of monocytes and T cells obtained in genetically deficient mice and in suitable models. A particular focus is placed on the contribution of platelet chemokines deposited on endothelium for monocyte arrest, on differences in the involvement of chemokines between recruitment to native lesions and to neointimal lesions after arterial injury, and on closely related functions of macrophage migration inhibitory factor, a cytokine with considerable structural homology to chemokines. As an evolving aspect of atherosclerotic vascular disease, a role of chemokines, foremost stromal cell-derived factor-1$\alpha$, in the recruitment of mononuclear progenitors of vascular cells during neointimal hyperplasia, endothelial recovery, and angiogenesis is discussed. The functional diversity and pleiotropy of chemokines in and beyond mononuclear cell recruitment awaits further elucidation to enable therapeutic targeting of atherogenesis by context-specific blockade of nonoverlapping chemokine receptor pairs.},

abstract = {Elevated platelet turnover contributes to high platelet reactivity. High platelet reactivity after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is associated with major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). The purpose of this study was to determine the prognostic value of platelet turnover and function with regard to MACE after PCI with stent implantation. In this prospective observational study, 486 consecutive patients after PCI on aspirin and clopidogrel were included to determine platelet turnover (mean platelet volume (MPV), reticulated platelet fraction (RPF)) and platelet function (multiple electrode aggregometry (MEA), vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein-phosphorylation (VASP-P) assay). At six-months follow-up, MACE occurred in 10.7 {\%} of patients. RPF (odds ratio [OR]=1.173 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI 95 {\%}] 1.040-1.324), p=0.009) and MPV (OR=1.459 (CI 95 {\%} 1.059-2.008), p=0.021) were univariable predictors of MACE, whereas VASP-P (OR=1.016 (CI 95 {\%} 1.000-1.032), p=0.052) and MEA (OR=0.999 (CI 95 {\%} 0.980-1.017), p=0.895) failed to predict MACE. RPF remained the only platelet variable independently associated with MACE. The best model to predict MACE included: troponin I (OR=1.007 (CI 95 {\%} 1.002-1.012), p=0.009), RPF (OR=1.136 (CI 95 {\%} 1.001-1.288), p=0.048), CRP (OR=1.008 (CI 95 {\%} 1.001-1.014), p=0.023) and history of myocardial infarction (OR=2.039 (CI 95 {\%} 1.093-3.806), p=0.025). RPF (OR=1.211 (CI 95 {\%} 1.042-1.406), p=0.012) was also independently associated with in-hospital bleedings. In conclusion, RPF as index of platelet turnover is an independent predictor of MACE and bleeding events in PCI patients on dual antiplatelet therapy. Since RPF can reliably be quantified along with routine haemograms, RPF might easily be applied in the setting of cardiovascular risk prediction.},

abstract = {Estimates of the marginal effect of measures of adiposity such as body mass index (BMI) on healthcare costs are important for the formulation and evaluation of policies targeting adverse weight profiles. Many existing estimates of this association are affected by endogeneity bias caused by simultaneity, measurement error and omitted variables. The contribution of this study is to avoid this bias by using a novel identification strategy – random germline genetic variation in an instrumental variable analysis – to identify the presence and magnitude of the causal effect of BMI on inpatient hospital costs. We also use data on genetic variants to undertake much richer testing of the sensitivity of results to potential violations of the instrumental variable assumptions than is possible with existing approaches. Using data on over 300,000 individuals, we found effect sizes for the marginal unit of BMI more than 50{\%} larger than multivariable effect sizes. These effects attenuated under sensitivity analyses, but remained larger than multivariable estimates for all but one estimator. There was little evidence for non-linear effects of BMI on hospital costs. Within-family estimates, intended to address dynastic biases, were null but suffered from low power. This paper is the first to use genetic variants in a Mendelian Randomization framework to estimate the causal effect of BMI (or any other disease/trait) on healthcare costs. This type of analysis can be used to inform the cost-effectiveness of interventions and policies targeting the prevention and treatment of overweight and obesity, and for setting research priorities.},

We report the results for platelet aggregation measured in whole blood from a subsample of 308 men. The index of sensitivity used was the minimum concentration of adenosine diphosphate that produced a defined degree of impedance change in the Chronolog 560 aggregometer. There was a marked association between aggregation and prevalent ischemic heart disease (IHD). The odds ratios and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CI) for prevalent IHD in men with the most sensitive platelets compared with those with the least sensitive platelets were 3.6 (95{\%} Cl: 1.1 to 12.2) for angina; 7.3 (95{\%} Cl: 2.0 to 24.3) for previous myocardial infarction (MI); and 2.7 (95{\%} Cl: 1.0 to 7.6) for electrocardiogram evidence of ischemia. The confidence limits for these odds ratios are large because of the small sample size, but the estimates of odds ratio are relatively large compared to similar relationships between the traditional risk factors of serum cholesterol, blood pressure, smoking, and prevalent IHD (1.5 to 2.5). A number of factors that might confound the relationships between platelets and IHD were examined, but the associations remained statistically significant when these were taken into account.},

abstract = {Platelets are known to contain platelet factor 4 and beta-thromboglobulin, alpha-chemokines containing the CXC motif, but recent studies extended the range to the beta-family characterized by the CC motif, including RANTES and Gro-alpha. There is also evidence for expression of chemokine receptors CCR4 and CXCR4 in platelets. This study shows that platelets have functional CCR1, CCR3, CCR4, and CXCR4 chemokine receptors. Polymerase chain reaction detected chemokine receptor messenger RNA in platelet RNA. CCR1, CCR3, and especially CCR4 gave strong signals; CXCR1 and CXCR4 were weakly positive. Flow cytometry with specific antibodies showed the presence of a clear signal for CXCR4 and weak signals for CCR1 and CCR3, whereas CXCR1, CXCR2, CXCR3, and CCR5 were all negative. Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting with polyclonal antibodies to cytoplasmic peptides clearly showed the presence of CCR1 and CCR4 in platelets in amounts comparable to monocytes and CCR4 transfected cells, respectively. Chemokines specific for these receptors, including monocyte chemotactic protein 1, macrophage inflammatory peptide 1alpha, eotaxin, RANTES, TARC, macrophage-derived chemokine, and stromal cell-derived factor 1, activate platelets to give Ca(++) signals, aggregation, and release of granule contents. Platelet aggregation was dependent on release of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and its interaction with platelet ADP receptors. Part, but not all, of the Ca(++) signal was due to ADP release feeding back to its receptors. Platelet activation also involved heparan or chondroitin sulfate associated with the platelet surface and was inhibited by cleavage of these glycosaminoglycans or by heparin or low molecular weight heparin. These platelet receptors may be involved in inflammatory or allergic responses or in platelet activation in human immunodeficiency virus infection.},

abstract = {Platelet activation is normally induced by primary agonists such as adenosine diphosphate (ADP), thrombin, and collagen, whereas other agonists, such as epinephrine, can play important accessory roles. It is now reported that the macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC), thymus activation-regulated chemokine (TARC), and stromal cell-derived factor one (SDF-1) are highly effective activators of platelet function under a variety of conditions, stimulating platelet shape change, aggregation, and adhesion to collagen or fibrinogen. Chemokine-mediated platelet activation was rapid and maximal (less than 5 seconds) under arterial flow conditions and depended strongly on the presence of low levels of primary agonists such as ADP or thrombin. Concentrations of ADP (0.05-0.25 microM) or thrombin (0.005-0.02 U/mL) that induced minimal aggregation caused major aggregation acting in combination with the chemokines. The ability of apyrase to block chemokine-dependent aggregation or adhesion was consistent with an important role for ADP. Chemokine-stimulated aggregation was also insensitive to indomethacin, suggesting that the activation of cyclo-oxygenase is not involved. TARC, MDC, and SDF-1 increased intracellular calcium concentrations [Ca(2+)](i) when combined with low levels of ADP. The MDC and TARC receptor CCR4 was expressed on platelets, and an anti-CCR4 antibody blocked aggregation induced by TARC or MDC. Treatment of platelets with SDF-1 and MDC rapidly exposed P-selectin (CD62P) on the cell surface but did not induce the secretion of serotonin. These findings suggest that the chemokines MDC, TARC, and SDF-1, which may be produced during inflammatory responses, coupled with low levels of ADP or thrombin, can serve as strong stimuli for activating platelet function.},

abstract = {Collagen activates platelets through a tyrosine kinase-dependent pathway, involving phospholipase Cgamma2. Functional responses such as aggregation and secretion induced by collagen are potentiated by preincubation with thrombopoietin (TPO). In this study, we show that collagen and thrombopoietin activate the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) pathway and that this contributes to their respective actions. The structurally distinct inhibitors of PI 3-kinase, wortmannin, and LY294002, completely inhibit formation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate by collagen. This leads to a substantial reduction in the formation of inositol phosphates and phosphatidic acid, 2 indices of PLC activity, and the consequent inhibition of intracellular Ca(++) [Ca(++)](i), aggregation and secretion. Potentiation of the collagen response by TPO is prevented in the presence of wortmannin and LY294002. However, when the 2 PI 3-kinase inhibitors are given after the addition of TPO but before the collagen, recovery of potentiation is observed. This suggests that potentiation is mediated through activation of PI 3-kinase. TPO stimulates aggregation of platelets from a low percentage of donors and this is also blocked by wortmannin. These results suggest that the PI 3-kinase pathway plays an important role in signaling by collagen and in the priming action of TPO.},

Although antiplatelet therapy is the cornerstone of antithrombotic treatment of ischemic cardiovascular disorders, available antiplatelet agents have less than satisfactory efficacy; thus, the identification of novel potential target candidates for antiplatelet therapy is highly warranted. Recent evidence suggests that several molecules that amplify the aggregation response of platelets to activating stimuli, which are either released by platelets (potentiating molecules) or present in the milieu before platelets get activated (primers), play a major role in pathologic thrombus formation without being significantly involved in primary haemostasis. These molecules appear to be a particularly appealing novel potential pharmacologic target for antiplatelet therapy. Here, we review the present knowledge on some molecules acting as potentiators or primers of platelet activation and discuss their possible pharmacologic modulation for antithrombotic purposes.},

Most MPD patients have a gain of function mutation in Janus kinase 2 (JAK2V617F), but little is known how JAK2V617F affects platelet function. Here, we demonstrate that platelets from ET patients have impaired SFLLRN-mediated fibrinogen binding and have lost the potentiating effect of thrombopoietin (which couples to JAK2) on this pathway. In contrast, SFLLRN-mediated P-selectin expression, ATP secretion, phosphorylation of the PKC substrate pleckstrin, and Ca2+ mobilization were unaffected in JAK2V617F positive platelets. In addition, thrombopoietin-mediated JAK2 phosphorylation was unchanged, suggesting that signaling pathways activated downstream of JAK2 are impaired. Indeed, we found that platelets from JAK2V617Fpositive ET patients have significantly reduced phosphorylation of the PI3 kinase substrate Akt, and have reduced activation of Rap1 in response to thrombopoietin, IGF-1,ADP, SFLLRN, and thrombin. This effect was independent of Gi P2Y12 purinergic receptor function as ADP-mediated inhibition of VASP phosphorylation was unchanged. These results demonstrate that the PI3 kinase/Rap1 pathway is intrinsically impaired in platelets from JAK2V617F-positive ET patients, resulting in diminished thrombin and thrombopoietin-mediated integrin $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 activation. {\textcopyright} 2013 by The American Society of Hematology.},

To understand the consequences of perturbations in plasma protein levels, we apply an integrated approach that links genetic variation with biological pathway, disease, and drug databases. We show that protein quantitative trait loci overlap with gene expression quantitative trait loci, as well as with disease-associated loci, and find evidence that protein biomarkers have causal roles in disease using Mendelian randomization analysis. By linking genetic factors to diseases via specific proteins, our analyses highlight potential therapeutic targets, opportunities for matching existing drugs with new disease indications, and potential safety concerns for drugs under development.},

abstract = {We performed imaging echocardiography, Doppler velocimetry, and repeated clinic and ambulatory blood pressure measurements in 74 hypertensive individuals to clarify why reports differ on the strength of the relationships of left ventricular characteristics with clinic blood pressure, on the superiority of ambulatory over clinic pressure, and on the importance of day-time and nighttime pressures. Clinic pressure was measured five times with an automated device and five times with the conventional technique on 2 different days. The partial correlation coefficients of left ventricular mass and wall thickness with the first automated systolic and diastolic clinic pressures amounted to .38 to .45 (P {\textless} .001), improved with increasing numbers of measurements, and reached .56 to .58 for the average of 10 automated pressure determinations. Similar trends were observed for conventional clinic pressures. Average 24-hour pressures were significantly related to mass and wall thickness (partial r = .50 to .61, P {\textless} .001) and explained 3{\%} to 6{\%} (systolic) and 5{\%} to 12{\%} (diastolic) of the variance of cardiac structure in addition to the first automated or conventional clinic pressure (P {\textless} .05). However, when 10 clinic measurements were averaged, only diastolic 24-hour pressure added information over and above clinic pressure (P {\textless} .05); the additional explained variance was larger with regard to the conventional (+4{\%} for mass and +7{\%} for wall thickness) rather than the automated (+3{\%} for wall thickness only) pressures. Mass and wall thickness were more closely related to day-time than nighttime pressures and were not independently related to day-night differences in pressure, except when men and women were considered separately; the results were similar when four different definitions of day and night were applied. Finally, the weak association of left ventricular diastolic function with blood pressure did not improve on repeated clinic or ambulatory blood pressure measurements. In conclusion, increasing numbers of measurements strengthen the relationships of clinic pressure with left ventricular mass and wall thickness and, conversely, diminish the additional predictive power of 24-hour blood pressure. The importance of nighttime pressure and of the nighttime pressure fall does not seem to depend on the definition of day and night but differs in men and women.},

Circulating FABP4 was marginally higher in patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (24.9 ng/mL) compared with controls (23.4 ng/mL; P=0.01).

abstract = {Inbred mice are a useful tool for studying the in vivo functions of platelets. Nonetheless, the mRNA signature of mouse platelets is not known. Here, we use pairedend next-generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to characterize the polyadenylated transcriptomes of human and mouse platelets. We report that RNA-seq provides unprecedented resolution of mRNAs that are expressed across the entire human and mouse genomes. Transcript expression and abundance are often conserved between the 2 species. Several mRNAs, however, are differentially expressed in human and mouse platelets. Moreover, previously described functional disparities between mouse and human platelets are reflected in differences at the transcript level, including protease activated receptor-1, protease activated receptor-3, platelet activating factor receptor, and factor V. This suggests that RNA-seq is a useful tool for predicting differences in platelet function between mice and humans. Our nextgeneration sequencing analysis provides new insights into the human and murine platelet transcriptomes. The sequencing dataset will be useful in the design of mouse models of hemostasis and a catalyst for discovery of new functions of platelets.

abstract = {It is recognized that a chronic low-grade inflammation and an activation of the immune system are involved in the pathogenesis of obesity-related insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Systemic inflammatory markers are risk factors for the development of type 2 diabetes and its macrovascular complications. Adipose tissue, liver, muscle and pancreas are themselves sites of inflammation in presence of obesity. An infiltration of macrophages and other immune cells is observed in these tissues associated with a cell population shift from an anti-inflammatory to a pro-inflammatory profile. These cells are crucial for the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which act in an autocrine and paracrine manner to interfere with insulin signaling in peripheral tissues or induce $\beta$-cell dysfunction and subsequent insulin deficiency. Particularly, the pro-inflammatory interleukin-1$\beta$ is implicated in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes through the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. The objectives of this review are to expose recent data supporting the role of the immune system in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes and to examine various mechanisms underlying this relationship. If type 2 diabetes is an inflammatory disease, anti-inflammatory therapies could have a place in prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes.},

abstract = {Plasma leptin levels are elevated in most obese individuals, and obesity is accompanied by a high incidence of cardiovascular disease. Therefore, leptin could be involved in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. In the present study, the role of leptin was explored in the regulation of platelet function. The expression of the long form of the leptin receptor was detected in human platelets. At 50 ng/ml, human leptin induced phosphorylation of several proteins of platelets at the tyrosine residue. Neither leptin at concentrations {\textless} or = 100 ng/ml nor ADP at concentrations {\textgreater} or = 1 micromol/l affected platelet aggregation. However, after pretreatment with 100 ng/ml leptin for 5 min, 1 micromol/l ADP caused aggregation. Thus, leptin and ADP acted synergistically. At a concentration of 2 micromol/l, ADP induced platelet aggregation, which was markedly enhanced by 30-100 ng/ml leptin in a concentration-dependent manner. This concentration range corresponds to that of plasma leptin levels in obese individuals. At the lower concentrations ({\textless} 10 ng/ml) that are observed in normal individuals, leptin had no effect on platelet aggregation. In conclusion, leptin at high concentrations has the novel function of promoting platelet aggregation, which may be a key coupling factor between obesity and the cardiovascular disease associated with syndrome X and diabetes.},

However, the functional variants or mechanistic consequences remain elusive. Intermediate traits such as gene expression or protein levels are good proxies of the metabolic state of an organism. Proteome analysis especially can provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of complex traits like obesity. The role of genetic variation in determining protein level variation has not been assessed in obesity. To address this, we design a large-scale protein quantitative trait locus (pQTL) analysis based on a set of 1129 proteins from 494 obese subjects before and after a weight loss intervention. This reveals 55 BMI-associated cis-pQTLs and trans-pQTLs at baseline and 3 trans-pQTLs after the intervention. We provide evidence for distinct genetic mechanisms regulating BMI-associated proteins before and after weight loss. Finally, by functional analysis, we identify and validate FAM46A as a trans regulator for leptin.},

abstract = {Platelet activation and subsequent thrombus formation at sites of vascular injury is crucial for normal hemostasis, but it can also cause myocardial infarction and stroke. The initial capture of flowing platelets to the injured vessel wall is mediated by the interaction of the glycoprotein (GP) Ib-V-IX complex with von Willebrand factor immobilized on the exposed subendothelial extracellular matrix. Tethered platelets are then able to bind to collagens through the immunoglobulin-like receptor GPVI and to initiate cellular activation, a process that is reinforced by G protein-coupled receptors stimulated by locally produced thrombin and soluble mediators released from activated platelets. These signaling events lead to a rise in the cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration, rearrangement of the cytoskeleton, release of granule content, and functional upregulation of integrin adhesion receptors allowing firm adhesion and thrombus growth. Fully activated platelets also undergo a procoagulant conversion thereby facilitating coagulation and thrombus stabilization. This review summarizes the most important receptor systems and signaling mechanisms involved in platelet activation and thrombus formation with special focus on recent discoveries.},

abstract = {Platelets are the smallest and perhaps the most versatile components of human blood. Besides their role in coagulation and the maintenance of vascular integrity, they are involved in many physiological processes, ranging from immune response and leukocyte recruitment to the production of antimicrobial peptides and immune-suppressive factors like TGF-$\beta$. These versatile abilities make platelets interesting for researchers from different disciplines. However, beside profound investigation into platelets' physiological role, there is a need for correct, standardized and thus reproducible quantification of platelet parameters.Mean platelet volume (MPV) is a widespread prognostic marker for several conditions, such as, acute coronary syndrome, chronic kidney disease and liver cirrhosis. Platelet activation is regarded as a marker for inflammatory processes, for example in autoimmune diseases such as type-1 diabetes, systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. The monitoring of platelet function is relevant for patients receiving antiplatelet medication. Platelet parameter measurement is affected by the choice of in vitro anticoagulant, the measurement technology and the time delay after sampling. This review focuses on the pre-analytical variability that arises as a result of the use of different in vitro anticoagulants and analyzer technologies when determining platelet parameters, since, even approximately 180 years after the discovery of platelets, there is still no standardized procedure.},

abstract = {In the brain, ouabain-like compounds (OLC) and the reninangiotensin system (RAS) contribute to sympathetic hyperactivity in rats after myocardial infarction (MI). This study aimed to evaluate changes in components of the central vs. the peripheral RAS. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and angiotensin type 1 (AT1) receptor binding densities were determined by measuring 125I-labeled 351A and 125I-labeled ANG II binding 4 and 8 wk after MI. In the brain, ACE and AT1 receptor binding increased 8-15{\%} in the subfornical organ, 14-22{\%} in the organum vasculosum laminae terminalis, 20-34{\%} in the paraventricular nucleus, and 13-15{\%} in the median preoptic nucleus. In the heart, the greatest increase in ACE and AT1 receptor binding occurred at the infarct scar (approximately 10-fold) and the least in the right ventricle (2-fold). In kidneys, ACE and AT1 receptor binding decreased 10-15{\%}. After intracerebroventricular infusion of Fab fragments to block brain OLC from 0.5 to 4 wk after MI, increases in ACE and AT1 receptors in the subfornical organ, organum vasculosum laminae terminalis, paraventricular nucleus, and medial preoptic nucleus were markedly inhibited, and ACE and AT1 receptor densities in the heart increased less (6-fold in the infarct scar). In kidneys, decreases in ACE and AT1 receptor binding were absent after treatment with Fab fragments. These results demonstrate that ACE and AT1 receptor binding densities increase not only in the heart but also in relevant areas of the brain of rats after MI. Brain OLC appears to play a major role in activation of brain RAS in rats after MI and, to a modest degree, in activation of the cardiac RAS.},

Recent genetic association analyses of the plasma proteome enable systematic evaluation of the causal consequences of variation in protein levels. Here, we estimated the effects of 1002 proteins on 225 phenotypes using two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) and colocalization. Of 413 associations supported by evidence from MR, 139 (34{\%}) were not supported by results of colocalization analyses, suggesting that genetic confounding may be widespread in naive phenome-wide association studies of proteins. Combining MR and colocalization evidence in cis-only analyses, we identified 105 putatively causal effects between 64 proteins and 51 downstream phenotypes (www.epigraphdb.org/pqtl). Evaluation of historic data from 268 drug development programmes showed that target-indication pairs with MR and colocalization support were considerably more likely to succeed, evidencing the value of this approach in identifying and prioritising potential therapeutic targets.},

BMI, waist circumference and WHR were measured to assess overweight and obesity.|The prevalence of obesity amongst Australian adults defined by BMI, waist circumference and WHR was 20.8, 30.5 and 15.8{\%} respectively. The unadjusted odds ratio for the fourth vs. first quartile of each obesity measurement showed that WHR had the strongest relationship with type 2 diabetes, dyslipidaemia (women only) and hypertension. Following adjustment for age, however, there was little difference between the three measures of obesity, with the possible exceptions of hypertension in women, where BMI had a stronger association, and dyslipidaemia in women and type 2 diabetes in men, where WHR was marginally superior.|Waist circumference, BMI and WHR identified different proportions of the population, as measured by both prevalence of obesity and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. Whilst WHR had the strongest correlations with CVD risk factors before adjustment for age, the three obesity measures performed similarly after adjustment for age. Given the difficulty of using age-adjusted associations in the clinical setting, these results suggest that given appropriate cut-off points, WHR is the most useful measure of obesity to use to identify individuals with CVD risk factors.},

We examined platelets from patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) compared with platelets from healthy volunteers to evaluate for differences in platelet phenotype and function. Platelet activation was examined and postreceptor signal transduction pathways were assessed. Platelet-derived plasma biomarkers were evaluated by receiver operator characteristic curve analysis. Maximum platelet activation through the thromboxane receptor was greater in STEMI than in NSTEMI but less through protease-activated receptor 1. Extracellular-signal related-kinase 5 activation, which can activate platelets, was increased in platelets from subjects with STEMI and especially in platelets from patients with NSTEMI. Matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) protein content and enzymatic activity were several-fold greater in platelets with MI than in control. Mean plasma MMP9 concentration in patients with MI distinguished between STEMI and NSTEMI (area under curve [AUC] 75{\%} [confidence interval (CI) 60-91], P = 0.006) which was superior to troponin T (AUC 66{\%} [CI 48-85, P = 0.08), predicting STEMI with 80{\%} sensitivity (95{\%} CI 56-94), 90{\%} specificity (CI 68-99), 70{\%} AUC (CI 54-86, P {\textless} 0.0001), and NSTEMI with 50{\%} sensitivity (CI 27-70), 90{\%} specificity (CI 68-99), 70{\%} AUC (CI 54-86, P = 0.03).

(2) Incubation with phospholipase A2 alone revealed a markedly increased susceptibility of the phospholipids in platelets activated by a mixture of collagen plus thrombin, by the SH-oxydizing compound diamide, or by calcium ionophore A23187, as compared to control platelets or platelets activated separately by collagen or thrombin. (3) Collagen plus thrombin, diamide, and ionophore treated platelets revealed an increased exposure of phosphatidylserine at the outer surface accompanied by a decreased exposure of sphingomyelin, as could be concluded from incubations with a combination of phospholipase A2 and sphingomyelinase. These alterations were much less apparent in platelets activated either by thrombin or by collagen alone. (4) The increased exposure of phosphatidylserine in activated platelets is accompanied by an increased ability of the platelets to enhance the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin by coagulation factor Xa, in the presence of factor Va and calcium. (5) It is concluded that the altered orientation of the phospholipids in the plasma membrane of platelets activated by collagen plus thrombin, by diamide, or by calcium ionophore, is the result of a transbilayer movement. Moreover, the increased exposure of phosphatidylserine in platelets stimulated by the combined action of collagen and thrombin might be of considerable importance for the hemostatic process. {\textcopyright} 1983.},

abstract = {The pathophysiology of heart failure (HF) is characterized by hemodynamic abnormalities that result in neurohormonal activation and autonomic imbalance with increase in sympathetic activity and withdrawal of vagal activity. Alterations in receptor activation from this autonomic imbalance may have profound effects on cardiac function and structure. Inhibition of the sympathetic drive to the heart through $\beta$-receptor blockade has become a standard component of therapy for HF with a dilated left ventricle because of its effectiveness in inhibiting the ventricular structural remodeling process and in prolonging life. Several devices for selective modulation of sympathetic and vagal activity have recently been developed in an attempt to alter the natural history of HF. The optimal counteraction of the excessive sympathetic activity is still unclear. A profound decrease in adrenergic support with excessive blockade of the sympathetic nervous system may result in adverse outcomes in clinical HF. In this review, we analyze the data supporting a contributory role of the autonomic functional alterations on the course of HF, the techniques used to assess autonomic nervous system activity, the evidence for clinical effectiveness of pharmacological and device interventions, and the potential future role of autonomic nervous system modifiers in the management of this syndrome.},

This study examined the associations of blood pressure measured in the clinic (clinic blood pressure) and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in a large cohort of patients in primary care.|We analyzed data from a registry-based, multicenter, national cohort that included 63,910 adults recruited from 2004 through 2014 in Spain. Clinic and 24-hour ambulatory blood-pressure data were examined in the following categories: sustained hypertension (elevated clinic and elevated 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure), "white-coat" hypertension (elevated clinic and normal 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure), masked hypertension (normal clinic and elevated 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure), and normotension (normal clinic and normal 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure). Analyses were conducted with Cox regression models, adjusted for clinic and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressures and for confounders.|During a median follow-up of 4.7 years, 3808 patients died from any cause, and 1295 of these patients died from cardiovascular causes. In a model that included both 24-hour and clinic measurements, 24-hour systolic pressure was more strongly associated with all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 1.58 per 1-SD increase in pressure; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.56 to 1.60, after adjustment for clinic blood pressure) than the clinic systolic pressure (hazard ratio, 1.02; 95{\%} CI, 1.00 to 1.04, after adjustment for 24-hour blood pressure). Corresponding hazard ratios per 1-SD increase in pressure were 1.55 (95{\%} CI, 1.53 to 1.57, after adjustment for clinic and daytime blood pressures) for nighttime ambulatory systolic pressure and 1.54 (95{\%} CI, 1.52 to 1.56, after adjustment for clinic and nighttime blood pressures) for daytime ambulatory systolic pressure. These relationships were consistent across subgroups of age, sex, and status with respect to obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and antihypertensive treatment. Masked hypertension was more strongly associated with all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 2.83; 95{\%} CI, 2.12 to 3.79) than sustained hypertension (hazard ratio, 1.80; 95{\%} CI, 1.41 to 2.31) or white-coat hypertension (hazard ratio, 1.79; 95{\%} CI, 1.38 to 2.32). Results for cardiovascular mortality were similar to those for all-cause mortality.|Ambulatory blood-pressure measurements were a stronger predictor of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality than clinic blood-pressure measurements. White-coat hypertension was not benign, and masked hypertension was associated with a greater risk of death than sustained hypertension. (Funded by the Spanish Society of Hypertension and others.).},

abstract = {Mesenchymal stem cells have the capacity to give rise to multiple cell types, such as adipocytes, osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and myocytes. However, the molecular events responsible for the lineage specification and differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells remain unclear. Using gene expression profile studies, we determined that Scavenger receptor class A, member 5 (SCARA5) is a novel mediator of adipocyte commitment. SCARA5 was expressed at a higher level in committed A33 preadipocyte cells compared to C3H10T1/2 pluripotent stem cells. Gain- and loss-of-function studies likewise revealed that SCARA5 acts as a mediator of adipocyte commitment and differentiation in both A33 and C3H10T1/2 cells. RNAi-mediated knockdown of SCARA5 in A33 cells markedly inhibited the adipogenic potential, whereas overexpression of SCARA5 enhanced adipocyte differentiation in C3H10T1/2 cells. We also demonstrated that the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and ERK signaling pathways is associated with the SCARA5-mediated response, thereby modulating adipocyte lineage commitment and adipocyte differentiation. Additionally, glucocorticoids induced the expression of SCARA5 in differentiating adipocytes through glucocorticoids response elements (GRE) in the SCARA5 promoter. Taken together, our study demonstrates that SCARA5 is a positive regulator in adipocyte lineage commitment and early adipogenesis in mesenchymal stem cells.},

abstract = {Sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P₁), an abundantly-expressed G protein-coupled receptor which regulates key vascular and immune responses, is a therapeutic target in autoimmune diseases. Fingolimod/Gilenya (FTY720), an oral medication for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, targets S1P₁ receptors on immune and neural cells to suppress neuroinflammation. However, suppression of endothelial S1P₁ receptors is associated with cardiac and vascular adverse effects. Here we report the genetic variations of the S1P₁ coding region from exon sequencing of {\textgreater}12,000 individuals and their functional consequences. We conducted functional analyses of 14 nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the S1PR1 gene. One SNP mutant (Arg¹²⁰ to Pro) failed to transmit sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P)-induced intracellular signals such as calcium increase and activation of p44/42 MAPK and Akt. Two other mutants (Ile⁴⁵ to Thr and Gly³⁰⁵ to Cys) showed normal intracellular signals but impaired S1P-induced endocytosis, which made the receptor resistant to FTY720-induced degradation. Another SNP mutant (Arg¹³ to Gly) demonstrated protection from coronary artery disease in a high cardiovascular risk population. Individuals with this mutation showed a significantly lower percentage of multi-vessel coronary obstruction in a risk factor-matched case-control study. This study suggests that individual genetic variations of S1P₁ can influence receptor function and, therefore, infer differential disease risks and interaction with S1P₁-targeted therapeutics.},

In a number of disease states, including human heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), this regulation can be disturbed and adversely affect outcome. The purpose of this review is to describe sympathetic activity at rest and during exercise in both healthy humans and those with HFrEF and outline factors, which influence these responses. We focus predominately on studies that report direct measurements of efferent sympathetic nerve traffic to skeletal muscle (muscle sympathetic nerve activity; MSNA) using intraneural microneurographic recordings. Differences in MSNA discharge between subjects with and without HFrEF both at rest and during exercise and the influence of exercise training on the sympathetic response to exercise will be discussed. In contrast to healthy controls, MSNA increases during mild to moderate dynamic exercise in the presence of HFrEF. This increase may contribute to the exercise intolerance characteristic of HFrEF by limiting muscle blood flow and may be attenuated by exercise training. Future investigations are needed to clarify the neural afferent mechanisms that contribute to efferent sympathetic activation at rest and during exercise in HFrEF.},

abstract = {Obesity is a serious international health problem that increases the risk of several common diseases. The genetic factors predisposing to obesity are poorly understood. A genome-wide search for type 2 diabetes-susceptibility genes identified a common variant in the FTO (fat mass and obesity associated) gene that predisposes to diabetes through an effect on body mass index (BMI). An additive association of the variant with BMI was replicated in 13 cohorts with 38,759 participants. The 16{\%} of adults who are homozygous for the risk allele weighed about 3 kilograms more and had 1.67-fold increased odds of obesity when compared with those not inheriting a risk allele. This association was observed from age 7 years upward and reflects a specific increase in fat mass.},

abstract = {Atherosclerosis is the underlying reason for nearly all causes of coronary artery disease and peripheral arterial disease and many cases of stroke. Atherosclerosis is a systemic inflammatory process characterised by the accumulation of lipids and macrophages/lymphocytes within the intima of large arteries. The deposition of these blood borne materials and the subsequent thickening of the wall often significantly compromise the residual lumen leading to ischaemic events distal to the arterial stenosis. However, these initial fatty streak lesions may also evolve into vulnerable plaques susceptible to rupture or erosion. Plaque disruption initiates both platelet adhesion and aggregation on the exposed vascular surface and the activation of the clotting cascade leading to the so-called atherothrombotic process. Yet, platelets have also been shown to be transporters of regulatory molecules (micro-RNA), to drive the inflammatory response and mediate atherosclerosis progression. Here we discuss our current understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in atherogenesis - from fatty streaks to complex and vulnerable atheromas - and highlight the molecular machinery used by platelets to regulate the atherogenic process, thrombosis and its clinical implications.},

abstract = {Inflammation plays a significant contributory role in the pathogenesis of chronic heart failure (CHF). Many studies have shown enhanced plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines [i.e. tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin (IL)-6] in patients with CHF. However, there are only few reports on the regulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10. IL-10 has potent deactivating properties in macrophages and T-cells and thus acts as a down-regulator of cell-mediated immune responses. The aim of the present study was to assess whether serum concentrations of IL-10 significantly differ between patients with CHF and healthy control subjects. Patients with CHF [ n =50; 66.9+/-12.6 years; mean ejection fraction, 22.1+/-9.2{\%}; New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II-IV] and 25 healthy controls (63.6+/-10.2 years) were examined. Of the 50 patients with CHF, 32 patients were taking aspirin (100 mg/day) and 33 patients had lipid-lowering therapy with a statin. Serum IL-10 as well as TNF-alpha concentrations were measured using commercially available immunoassays. Patients with CHF showed significantly lower IL-10 concentrations (2.3+/-1.9 compared with 5.2+/-2.3 pg/ml; P {\textless}0.001). Patients with advanced CHF (NYHA class III and IV) had the lowest IL-10 plasma levels. Aspirin and statin therapy did not significantly influence serum levels of IL-10. The ratio of TNF-alpha to IL-10 was significantly higher in patients with advanced CHF (NYHA class III and IV, ratio 3.2+/-1.2 and 3.1+/-1.1 respectively, compared with control 0.4+/-0.2; P {\textless}0.01). Our present study demonstrates significantly decreased serum levels of IL-10 in patients with advanced CHF. Since IL-10 is known as a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine, its decrease in advanced CHF may favour the inflammatory milieu in CHF.},

abstract = {Stroke is one of the leading cause of disability and death worldwide. Evidence suggests that variants of genes involved in different pathways modulate the susceptibility to stroke. Various treatments given to these patients target the relevant pathways to achieve the required therapeutic response. Antiplatelet agents underscore the crucial role of platelets in the pathogenesis of stroke. Higher platelet reactivity in terms of mean platelet volume (MPV) and platelet count (PLT) contributes significantly to the interindividual variation in platelet reaction at the site of vessel wall injury. Some individuals encounter thrombotic events as platelets get occluded at the site of vessel wall injury whereas others heal the injury without occluding the circulation. There has been compelling evidence that MPV and PLT have a strong genetic component. Several high throughput techniques including genome-wide association studies (GWAS), whole exome sequencing (WES), whole genome sequencing (WGS), phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) and multi-omic analysis have been employed to identify the genetic variants influencing MPV and PLT. In this review, we highlight the recent breakthroughs in understanding the genetic component affecting MPV and PLT. Evaluating the biological function of genetic factors is an important step in understanding the association of platelet count and volume with stroke susceptibility.},

Seventy-four patients (median age, 13.5 years; 74{\%} boys) were examined, 40 of whom had primary HTN. Body mass index z score and age were independent predictors of systolic ARV (R(2) =0.14) and SD (R(2) =0.39). There were no statistically significant differences in overall or wake period BPV measures between secondary or primary HTN groups, but sleep period diastolic SD was significantly greater in the secondary HTN group (9.26±3.8 vs 7.1±2.8, P=.039).

VASP is substrate of cAMP-dependent, cGMP-dependent and AMP-activated protein kinases that primarily phosphorylate the sites S157, S239 and T278, respectively. Here, we systematically analyzed functions of VASP phosphorylation patterns for actin assembly and subcellular targeting in vivo and compared the phosphorylation effects of Ena/VASP family members. Methods used were the reconstitution of VASP-null cells with ;locked' phosphomimetic VASP mutants, actin polymerization of VASP mutants in vitro and in living cells, site-specific kinase-mediated VASP phosphorylation, and analysis of the endogenous protein with phosphorylation-status-specific antibodies. Phosphorylation at S157 influenced VASP localization, but had a minor impact on F-actin assembly. Phosphorylation of the S157-equivalent site in the Ena/VASP family members Mena and EVL had no effect on the ratio of cellular F-actin to G-actin. By contrast, VASP phosphorylation at S239 (and the equivalent site in Mena) or T278 impaired VASP-driven actin filament formation. The data show that VASP functions are precisely regulated by differential phosphorylation and provide new insights into cytoskeletal control by serine/threonine kinase-dependent signaling pathways.},

abstract = {Many statistical tests rely on the assumption that the residuals of a model are normally distributed. Rank-based inverse normal transformation (INT) of the dependent variable is one of the most popular approaches to satisfy the normality assumption. When covariates are included in the analysis, a common approach is to first adjust for the covariates and then normalize the residuals. This study investigated the effect of regressing covariates against the dependent variable and then applying rank-based INT to the residuals. The correlation between the dependent variable and covariates at each stage of processing was assessed. An alternative approach was tested in which rank-based INT was applied to the dependent variable before regressing covariates. Analyses based on both simulated and real data examples demonstrated that applying rank-based INT to the dependent variable residuals after regressing out covariates re-introduces a linear correlation between the dependent variable and covariates, increasing type-I errors and reducing power. On the other hand, when rank-based INT was applied prior to controlling for covariate effects, residuals were normally distributed and linearly uncorrelated with covariates. This latter approach is therefore recommended in situations were normality of the dependent variable is required.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and biliopancreatic diversion can markedly ameliorate diabetes in morbidly obese patients, often resulting in disease remission. Prospective, randomized trials comparing these procedures with medical therapy for the treatment of diabetes are needed. METHODS: In this single-center, nonblinded, randomized, controlled trial, 60 patients between the ages of 30 and 60 years with a body-mass index (BMI, the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) of 35 or more, a history of at least 5 years of diabetes, and a glycated hemoglobin level of 7.0{\%} or more were randomly assigned to receive conventional medical therapy or undergo either gastric bypass or biliopancreatic diversion. The primary end point was the rate of diabetes remission at 2 years (defined as a fasting glucose level of {\textless}100 mg per deciliter [5.6 mmol per liter] and a glycated hemoglobin level of {\textless}6.5{\%} in the absence of pharmacologic therapy). RESULTS: At 2 years, diabetes remission had occurred in no patients in the medical-therapy group versus 75{\%} in the gastric-bypass group and 95{\%} in the biliopancreatic-diversion group (P{\textless}0.001 for both comparisons). Age, sex, baseline BMI, duration of diabetes, and weight changes were not significant predictors of diabetes remission at 2 years or of improvement in glycemia at 1 and 3 months. At 2 years, the average baseline glycated hemoglobin level (8.65+/-1.45{\%}) had decreased in all groups, but patients in the two surgical groups had the greatest degree of improvement (average glycated hemoglobin levels, 7.69+/-0.57{\%} in the medical-therapy group, 6.35+/-1.42{\%} in the gastric-bypass group, and 4.95+/-0.49{\%} in the biliopancreatic-diversion group). CONCLUSIONS: In severely obese patients with type 2 diabetes, bariatric surgery resulted in better glucose control than did medical therapy. Preoperative BMI and weight loss did not predict the improvement in hyperglycemia after these procedures. (Funded by Catholic University of Rome; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00888836.).},

abstract = {Huntington's disease (HD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder for which no effective cure is yet available. Although several agents have been identified to provide benefits so far, the number of therapeutic options remains limited with only symptomatic treatment available. Over the past few years, we have demonstrated that sphingolipid-based approaches may open the door to new and more targeted treatments for the disease. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of stimulating sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor 5 by the new selective agonist A-971432 (provided by AbbVie) in R6/2 mice, a widely used HD animal model. Chronic administration of low-dose (0.1 mg/kg) A-971432 slowed down the progression of the disease and significantly prolonged lifespan in symptomatic R6/2 mice. Such beneficial effects were associated with activation of pro-survival pathways (BDNF, AKT and ERK) and with reduction of mutant huntingtin aggregation. A-971432 also protected blood-brain barrier (BBB) homeostasis in the same mice. Interestingly, when administered early in the disease, before any overt symptoms, A-971432 completely protected HD mice from the classic progressive motor deficit and preserved BBB integrity. Beside representing a promising strategy to take into consideration for the development of alternative therapeutic options for HD, selective stimulation of S1P receptor 5 may be also seen as an effective approach to target brain vasculature defects in the disease.},

abstract = {Developments in genome-wide association studies and the increasing availability of summary genetic association data have made application of Mendelian randomization relatively straightforward. However, obtaining reliable results from a Mendelian randomization investigation remains problematic, as the conventional inverse-variance weighted method only gives consistent estimates if all of the genetic variants in the analysis are valid instrumental variables. We present a novel weighted median estimator for combining data on multiple genetic variants into a single causal estimate. This estimator is consistent even when up to 50{\%} of the information comes from invalid instrumental variables. In a simulation analysis, it is shown to have better finite-sample Type 1 error rates than the inverse-variance weighted method, and is complementary to the recently proposed MR-Egger (Mendelian randomization-Egger) regression method. In analyses of the causal effects of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol on coronary artery disease risk, the inverse-variance weighted method suggests a causal effect of both lipid fractions, whereas the weighted median and MR-Egger regression methods suggest a null effect of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol that corresponds with the experimental evidence. Both median-based and MR-Egger regression methods should be considered as sensitivity analyses for Mendelian randomization investigations with multiple genetic variants.},

abstract = {Essential hypertension is idiopathic although it is accepted as a complex polygenic trait with underlying genetic components, which remain unknown. Our supposition is that hypertension involves activation of the sympathetic nervous system. One pivotal region controlling arterial pressure set point is nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS). We recently identified that pro-inflammatory molecules, such as junctional adhesion molecule-1 (JAM-1), were over expressed in endothelial cells of the microvasculature supplying the NTS in an animal model of human hypertension (the spontaneously hypertensive rat) compared to normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). Over expression of JAM-1 in NTS of WKY rats was pro-hypertensive and induced leukocyte adherence to the microvasculature. Since leukocyte adhesion causes cytokine release, we found expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) was higher in the NTS of SHR while inter-leukin-6 (IL-6) was lower compared to the WKY rat. Inflammation of the brainstem microvasculature may increase vascular resistance within the brainstem. High brainstem vascular resistance and its inflammation may release pathological paracrine signaling molecules affecting central neural cardiovascular activity conducive to neurogenic hypertension.},

Interestingly, the adapter protein CrkL and the active form of Src (phosphorylated in Tyr418) were found to be upregulated in platelets from STEMI patients. Major signaling pathways related to the proteins identified include integrin, integrin-linked kinase, and glycoprotein VI (GPVI) signaling.

@article{Burgess2016,
abstract = {Mendelian randomization analyses are often performed using summarized data. The causal estimate from a one-sample analysis (in which data are taken from a single data source) with weak instrumental variables is biased in the direction of the observational association between the risk factor and outcome, whereas the estimate from a two-sample analysis (in which data on the risk factor and outcome are taken from non-overlapping datasets) is less biased and any bias is in the direction of the null. When using genetic consortia that have partially overlapping sets of participants, the direction and extent of bias are uncertain. In this paper, we perform simulation studies to investigate the magnitude of bias and Type 1 error rate inflation arising from sample overlap. We consider both a continuous outcome and a case-control setting with a binary outcome. For a continuous outcome, bias due to sample overlap is a linear function of the proportion of overlap between the samples. So, in the case of a null causal effect, if the relative bias of the one-sample instrumental variable estimate is 10{\%} (corresponding to an F parameter of 10), then the relative bias with 50{\%} sample overlap is 5{\%}, and with 30{\%} sample overlap is 3{\%}. In a case-control setting, if risk factor measurements are only included for the control participants, unbiased estimates are obtained even in a one-sample setting. However, if risk factor data on both control and case participants are used, then bias is similar with a binary outcome as with a continuous outcome. Consortia releasing publicly available data on the associations of genetic variants with continuous risk factors should provide estimates that exclude case participants from case-control samples.},

Classical observational studies provide na{\"{i}}ve estimates of the likely role of biomarkers in disease development; however, such studies are prone to bias. This has direct relevance for drug development as if drug targets track to non-causal biomarkers, this can lead to expensive failure of these drugs in phase III randomised controlled trials. In an effort to provide a more reliable indication of the likely causal role of a biomarker in the development of disease, Mendelian randomisation studies are increasingly used, and this is facilitated by the availability of large-scale genetic data. We conducted a narrative review in order to provide a description of the utility of Mendelian randomisation for clinicians engaged in cardiovascular research. We describe the rationale and provide a basic description of the methods and potential limitations of Mendelian randomisation. We give examples from the literature where Mendelian randomisation has provided pivotal information for drug discovery including predicting efficacy, informing on target-mediated adverse effects and providing potential new evidence for drug repurposing. The variety of the examples presented illustrates the importance of Mendelian randomisation in order to prioritise drug targets for cardiovascular research.},

Amongst these are NF-$\kappa$B-mediated tumor cell survival and fibroblast chemotaxis to fibronectin. Here we report our efforts to identify selective chemical probes for S1PR2 and their characterization. We employed high throughput screening to identify two compounds which activate the S1PR2 receptor. SAR optimization led to compounds with high nanomolar potency. These compounds, XAX-162 and CYM-5520, are highly selective and do not activate other S1P receptors. Binding of CYM-5520 is not competitive with the antagonist JTE-013. Mutation of receptor residues responsible for binding to the zwitterionic headgroup of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) abolishes S1P activation of the receptor, but not activation by CYM-5520. Competitive binding experiments with radiolabeled S1P demonstrate that CYM-5520 is an allosteric agonist and does not displace the native ligand. Computational modeling suggests that CYM-5520 binds lower in the orthosteric binding pocket, and that co-binding with S1P is energetically well tolerated. In summary, we have identified an allosteric S1PR2 selective agonist compound.},

Participants whose subjective sleep quality was less than usual on either ABPM did not have higher nocturnal BP levels than those who slept similar to usual (P {\textgreater} 0.05). When comparing the nocturnal BP levels between the first and second ABPM, we found that participants whose subjective sleep quality was less on the second ABPM had significantly higher pressure levels and a smaller BP dip than participants with a similar sleep quality for both ABPMs (P {\textless} 0.05). Accordingly, the correlations between the nocturnal BP and cardiac damage tended to be weaker based on the ABPM with the lowest sleep quality.|Subjectively assessed sleep disturbance during overnight BP monitoring increases the nocturnal BP level and potentially attenuates the correlation with hypertension-related cardiac damage, even though habituation to overnight BP monitoring occurs.},

Applying fine-mapping analysis to 233 known and new loci associated with the 20 traits, we resolve the associations of 59 loci to credible sets of 20 or fewer variants and describe trait enrichments within regions of predicted regulatory function. These findings improve understanding of the allelic architecture of risk factors for cardiometabolic and hematological diseases and provide additional functional insights with the identification of potentially novel biological targets.},

abstract = {Mendelian randomization (MR) is a burgeoning field that involves the use of genetic variants to assess causal relationships between exposures and outcomes. MR studies can be straightforward; for example, genetic variants within or near the encoding locus that is associated with protein concentrations can help to assess their causal role in disease. However, a more complex relationship between the genetic variants and an exposure can make findings from MR more difficult to interpret. In this Review, we describe some of these challenges in interpreting MR analyses, including those from studies using genetic variants to assess causality of multiple traits (such as branched-chain amino acids and risk of diabetes mellitus); studies describing pleiotropic variants (for example, C-reactive protein and its contribution to coronary heart disease); and those investigating variants that disrupt normal function of an exposure (for example, HDL cholesterol or IL-6 and coronary heart disease). Furthermore, MR studies on variants that encode enzymes responsible for the metabolism of an exposure (such as alcohol) are discussed, in addition to those assessing the effects of variants on time-dependent exposures (extracellular superoxide dismutase), cumulative exposures (LDL cholesterol), and overlapping exposures (triglycerides and non-HDL cholesterol). We elaborate on the molecular features of each relationship, and provide explanations for the likely causal associations. In doing so, we hope to contribute towards more reliable evaluations of MR findings.},

The ensemble of inflammatory mediators that have been detected in heart failure patients include pro-inflammatory cytokines and their cognate receptors, as well as molecules secreted/released by macrophages (galectin-3 and pentraxin-3). Inflammatory biomarkers correlate with disease severity and prognosis across the broad spectrum of heart failure syndromes. Given the proliferation of new biomarkers that predict disease severity and prognosis in heart failure, it is reasonable to ask whether there is a current role for measuring inflammatory mediators in heart failure. This review will attempt to address this question, as well as review several novel approaches that have utilized inflammatory biomarkers to enhance risk stratification and prognosis in heart failure patients.},

abstract = {Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is a heme-containing enzyme released from activated leukocytes into the extracellular space during inflammation. Its main function is the production of hypohalous acids that are potent oxidants. MPO can also modulate cell signaling and inflammatory responses independently of its enzymatic activity. Because MPO is regarded as an important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases associated with increased platelet activity, we studied the effects of MPO on human platelet functional properties. Laser scanning confocal microscopy was used to reveal carbohydrate-independent MPO binding to human platelet membrane. Adding MPO to platelets did not activate their aggregation under basal conditions (without agonist). In contrast, MPO augmented agonist-induced platelet aggregation, which was not prevented by MPO enzymatic activity inhibitors. It was found that exposure of platelets to MPO leads to actin cytoskeleton reorganization and an increase in their elasticity. Furthermore, MPO evoked a rise in cytosolic Ca2+ through enhancement of store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE). Together, these findings indicate that MPO is not a direct agonist but rather a mediator that binds to human platelets, induces actin cytoskeleton reorganization and affects the mechanical stiffness of human platelets, resulting in potentiating SOCE and agonist-induced human platelet aggregation. Therefore, an increased activity of platelets in vascular disease can, at least partly, be provided by MPO elevated concentrations.},

We used a sample of 8,121 children from the ALSPAC dataset, and tested the linear association of a BMI-associated allele score with 172 phenotypic outcomes (with variable sample sizes). We also performed an instrumental variable analysis to estimate the causal effect of BMI on each phenotype.

Diuretics are widely used to attenuate symptoms and signs of congestion in both heart failure with preserved and reduced ejection fraction, although their effects on long-term prognosis of both phenotypes of heart failure have not been demonstrated because of an ethical difficulty in designing a randomized and prospective clinical trial. Guidelines do not provide any guidance on therapy choice, and physicians blindly choose furosemide among loop diuretics in current clinical settings. However, several clinical studies have suggested that the effects of loop diuretics are not consistent, and that furosemide is not necessarily preferable as compared with other loop diuretics. We should pay attention to the choice of loop diuretics. Regarding the improvement of long-term prognosis, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker, mineralocorticoid receptor blocker and $\beta$-blocker are proven effective for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. However, none of these drugs have improved prognosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction in clinical trials. Observational studies and subanalysis of clinical trials suggest the benefits of these drugs in this phenotype of heart failure. All of clinical trials and observational studies present facts to us, and let us recognize that "one size fits all approach" may be a cause for a lack of evidence about the therapeutic strategy of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction until now. We have to make efforts to clarify characteristics of patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction to whom the administration of each drug provides benefits or do not.},

abstract = {The thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor is expressed in the megakaryocytic lineage from late progenitors to platelets. We investigated the effect of TPO on the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation pathway in human platelets. TPO by itself did not activate ERK1, ERK2 and protein kinase C (PKC), whereas TPO directly enhanced the PKC-dependent activation of ERKs induced by other agonists including thrombin and phorbol esters, without affecting the PKC activation by those agonists. TPO did not activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinases, MEK1 and MEK2, but activated Raf-1 and directly augmented the PKC-mediated MEK activation, suggesting that TPO primarily potentiates the ERK pathway through regulating MEKs or upstream steps of MEKs including Raf-1. The MEK inhibitor PD098059 failed to affect not only thrombin-induced or phorbol ester-induced aggregation, but also potentiation of aggregation by TPO, denying the primary involvement of ERKs and MEKs in those events. ERKs and MEKs were located mainly in the detergent-soluble/non-cytoskeletal fractions. ERKs but not MEKs were relocated to the cytoskeleton following platelet aggregation and actin polymerization. These data indicate that TPO synergizes with other agonists in the ERK activation pathway of platelets and that this synergy might affect functions of the cytoskeleton possibly regulated by ERKs.},

Data are very scanty on younger men and on women. For middle-aged women, it appears that they are like the men in regard to the risk associated with relative weight.

However, it is unclear whether the associations between cardiovascular disease and common measures of socioeconomic status-wealth and education-differ among high-income, middle-income, and low-income countries, and, if so, why these differences exist. We explored the association between education and household wealth and cardiovascular disease and mortality to assess which marker is the stronger predictor of outcomes, and examined whether any differences in cardiovascular disease by socioeconomic status parallel differences in risk factor levels or differences in management.|In this large-scale prospective cohort study, we recruited adults aged between 35 years and 70 years from 367 urban and 302 rural communities in 20 countries. We collected data on families and households in two questionnaires, and data on cardiovascular risk factors in a third questionnaire, which was supplemented with physical examination. We assessed socioeconomic status using education and a household wealth index. Education was categorised as no or primary school education only, secondary school education, or higher education, defined as completion of trade school, college, or university. Household wealth, calculated at the household level and with household data, was defined by an index on the basis of ownership of assets and housing characteristics. Primary outcomes were major cardiovascular disease (a composite of cardiovascular deaths, strokes, myocardial infarction, and heart failure), cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality. Information on specific events was obtained from participants or their family.|Recruitment to the study began on Jan 12, 2001, with most participants enrolled between Jan 6, 2005, and Dec 4, 2014. 160 299 (87{\textperiodcentered}9{\%}) of 182 375 participants with baseline data had available follow-up event data and were eligible for inclusion. After exclusion of 6130 (3{\textperiodcentered}8{\%}) participants without complete baseline or follow-up data, 154 169 individuals remained for analysis, from five low-income, 11 middle-income, and four high-income countries.

abstract = {Blood platelets play critical roles in hemostasis, providing rapid essential protection against bleeding and catalyzing the important slower formation of stable blood clots via the coagulation cascade. They are also involved in protection from infection by phagocytosis of pathogens and by secreting chemokines that attract leukocytes. Platelet function usually is activated by primary agonists such as adenosine diphosphate (ADP), thrombin, and collagen, whereas secondary agonists like adrenalin do not induce aggregation on their own but become highly effective in the presence of low levels of primary agonists. Current research has revealed that chemokines represent an important additional class of agonists capable of causing significant activation of platelet function. Early work on platelet alpha-granule proteins suggested that platelet factor 4, now known as CXCL4, modulated aggregation and secretion induced by low agonist levels. Subsequent reports revealed the presence in platelets of messenger RNA for several additional chemokines and chemokine receptors. Three chemokines in particular, CXCL12 (SDF-1), CCL17 (TARC), and CCL22 (MDC), recently have been shown to be strong and rapid activators of platelet aggregation and adhesion after their binding to platelet CXCR4 or CCR4, when acting in combination with low levels of primary agonists. CXCL12 can be secreted by endothelial cells and is present in atherosclerotic plaques, whereas CCL17 and CCL22 are secreted by monocytes and macrophages. Platelet activation leads to the release of alpha-granule chemokines, including CCL3 (MIP-1alpha), CCL5 (RANTES), CCL7 (MCP-3), CCL17, CXCL1 (growth-regulated oncogene-alpha), CXCL5 (ENA-78), and CXCL8 (IL-8), which attract leukocytes and further activate other platelets. These findings help to provide a direct linkage between hemostasis, infection, and inflammation and the development of atherosclerosis.},

abstract = {Autonomic neurons help to regulate immune responses, and there are reciprocal interactions between the nervous and immune systems. This study seeks to define some of the molecular mechanisms that may underlie such interactions. Immunoblot analysis indicated that cultured sympathetic neurons synthesize and release the cytokine interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta). In addition, RNA blot analysis of cultured sympathetic neurons demonstrated that the neurons contain mRNA encoding IL-1 beta. It was previously shown that explant cultures of sympathetic ganglia and dissociated cocultures of neurons with ganglionic nonneuronal cells synthesize substance P, whereas in situ levels of substance P and its mRNA are low. An antagonist at the interleukin 1 receptor markedly depressed this increase in substance P in cultures, suggesting that endogenous IL-1 beta mediates the synthetic response, at least in part. Because pure neuronal cultures do not contain substance P and neurons synthesize and release IL-1 beta, the actions of the cytokine require the presence of ganglion nonneuronal cells. These observations suggest a role for autonomic neurons in influencing immune responses by synthesizing and secreting at least two known immunoregulators, the cytokine IL-1 beta and the neuropeptide substance P.},

We conducted a systematic review to assess the predictive power of reported BPV indexes to address appropriate quantification of 24-hour BPV, including the average real variability (ARV) index.|Studies chosen for review were those that presented data for 24-hour BPV in adults from meta-analysis, longitudinal or cross-sectional design, and examined BPV in terms of the following issues: (1) methods used to calculate and evaluate ARV; (2) assessment of 24-hour BPV determined using noninvasive ambulatory BP monitoring; (3) multivariate analysis adjusted for covariates, including some measure of BP; (4) association of 24-hour BPV with subclinical organ damage; and (5) the predictive value of 24-hour BPV on target organ damage and rate of cardiovascular events.

@article{Triposkiadis2009,
abstract = {Heart failure is a syndrome characterized initially by left ventricular dysfunction that triggers countermeasures aimed to restore cardiac output. These responses are compensatory at first but eventually become part of the disease process itself leading to further worsening cardiac function. Among these responses is the activation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) that provides inotropic support to the failing heart increasing stroke volume, and peripheral vasoconstriction to maintain mean arterial perfusion pressure, but eventually accelerates disease progression affecting survival. Activation of SNS has been attributed to withdrawal of normal restraining influences and enhancement of excitatory inputs including changes in: 1) peripheral baroreceptor and chemoreceptor reflexes; 2) chemical mediators that control sympathetic outflow; and 3) central integratory sites. The interface between the sympathetic fibers and the cardiovascular system is formed by the adrenergic receptors (ARs). Dysregulation of cardiac beta(1)-AR signaling and transduction are key features of heart failure progression. In contrast, cardiac beta(2)-ARs and alpha(1)-ARs may function in a compensatory fashion to maintain cardiac inotropy. Adrenergic receptor polymorphisms may have an impact on the adaptive mechanisms, susceptibilities, and pharmacological responses of SNS. The beta-AR blockers and the inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis form the mainstay of current medical management of chronic heart failure. Conversely, central sympatholytics have proved harmful, whereas sympathomimetic inotropes are still used in selected patients with hemodynamic instability. This review summarizes the changes in SNS in heart failure and examines how modulation of SNS activity may affect morbidity and mortality from this syndrome.},

Here, we map the S1P(3) binding pocket with a novel allosteric agonist (CYM-5541), an orthosteric agonist (S1P), and a novel bitopic antagonist (SPM-242). With a combination of site-directed mutagenesis, ligand competition assay, and molecular modeling, we concluded that S1P and CYM-5541 occupy different chemical spaces in the ligand binding pocket of S1P(3). CYM-5541 allowed us to identify an allosteric site where Phe263 is a key gate-keeper residue for its affinity and efficacy. This ligand lacks a polar moiety, and the novel allosteric hydrophobic pocket permits S1P(3) selectivity of CYM-5541 within the highly similar S1P receptor family. However, a novel S1P(3)-selective antagonist, SPM-242, in the S1P(3) pocket occupies the ligand binding spaces of both S1P and CYM-5541, showing its bitopic mode of binding. Therefore, our coordinated approach with biochemical data and molecular modeling, based on our recently published S1P(1) crystal structure data in a highly conserved set of related receptors with a shared ligand, provides a strong basis for the successful optimization of orthosteric, allosteric, and bitopic modulators of S1P(3).},

Using a minocycline-resistant strain of Staphylococcus aureus to dissect the antibiotic's bacteriostatic versus immune modulatory effects in a mouse experimental brain abscess model, we found that minocycline significantly reduced mortality rates within the first 24 hours following bacterial exposure. This protection was associated with a transient decrease in the expression of several proinflammatory mediators, including interleukin-1beta and CCL2 (MCP-1). Minocycline was also capable of protecting the brain parenchyma from necrotic damage as evident by significantly smaller abscesses in minocycline-treated mice. In addition, minocycline exerted anti-inflammatory effects when administered as late as 3 days following S. aureus infection, which correlated with a significant decrease in brain abscess size. Finally, minocycline was capable of partially attenuating S. aureus-dependent microglial and astrocyte activation. Therefore, minocycline may afford additional therapeutic benefits extending beyond its antimicrobial activity for the treatment of central nervous system infectious diseases typified by a pathogenic inflammatory component through its ability to balance beneficial versus detrimental inflammation.},

We particularly focus on variants in gene regions that are proxies for specific pharmacologic agents for lipid therapy. We then conduct a 2-sample Mendelian randomization investigation to assess the causal roles of LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides on AMD risk. We also conduct parallel investigations for coronary artery disease (CAD) (viewed as a positive control) and Alzheimer's disease (a negative control) for comparison.|Diagnosis of AMD.|We find evidence that HDL-cholesterol is a causal risk factor for AMD, with an odds ratio (OR) estimate of 1.22 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.03-1.44) per 1 standard deviation increase in HDL-cholesterol. No causal effect of LDL-cholesterol or triglycerides was found. Variants in the CETP gene region associated with increased circulating HDL-cholesterol also associate with increased AMD risk, although variants in the LIPC gene region that increase circulating HDL-cholesterol have the opposite direction of association with AMD risk. Parallel analyses suggest that lipids have a greater role for AMD compared with Alzheimer's disease, but a lesser role than for CAD.|Some genetic evidence suggests that HDL-cholesterol is a causal risk factor for AMD risk and that increasing HDL-cholesterol (particularly via CETP inhibition) will increase AMD risk.},

The effect of left ventricular dilatation on the risk of heart failure in people initially free of myocardial infarction is not known.|We examined the relation of the left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic internal dimensions, as measured by M-mode echocardiography, to the risk of congestive heart failure in 4744 subjects (2083 men and 2661 women) who had not sustained a myocardial infarction and who were free of congestive heart failure. We used sex-stratified proportional-hazards regression to assess the association between base-line left ventricular internal dimensions and the subsequent risk of congestive heart failure, after adjusting for age, blood pressure, hypertension treatment, body-mass index, diabetes, valve disease, and interim myocardial infarction.|Over an 11-year follow-up period, congestive heart failure developed in 74 subjects (38 men and 36 women). The risk-factor-adjusted hazard ratio for congestive heart failure was 1.47 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.25 to 1.73) for an increment of 1 SD in the left ventricular end-diastolic dimension, indexed for height. We obtained similar results using the left ventricular end-systolic dimension (hazard ratio, 1.43; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.24 to 1.65).|An increase in left ventricular internal dimension is a risk factor for congestive heart failure in men and women who have not had a myocardial infarction. Knowledge of the left ventricular dimension improves predictions of the risk of congestive heart failure made on the basis of traditional risk factors, perhaps by aiding in the identification of subjects with subclinical left ventricular dysfunction.},

abstract = {As insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is present in the alpha granules of platelets and its receptor is expressed on the platelet surface, it may contribute to the amplification of platelet responses and pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. The functional and signaling pathways that are involved in IGF-1 modulation of platelet function, however, are presently unknown. Here, I report that IGF-1 stimulation of platelets results in dose-dependent phosphorylation of the IGF receptor in the range of 1 to 100 nM. Phosphorylation of the IGF receptor is rapid and sustained, with maximal phosphorylation reached within 1 minute. Furthermore, IGF-1 stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and IRS-2 and their association with the p85 subunit of phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K). IGF-1-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2 and subsequent p85 binding is transient and precedes phosphorylation of protein kinase B (PKB) on Ser473. PAR-1-mediated platelet aggregation is potentiated by IGF-1 and this potentiation, together with PKB phosphorylation, is abolished by the PI3Kalpha inhibitors PI-103 and PIK-75. Importantly, the IGF receptor inhibitor NVP-AEW541 and the neutralization antibody alphaIR3 inhibit SFLLRN-stimulated aggregation, implicating IGF-1 in autocrine regulation of platelet function. These results demonstrate that IGF-1 activates the IGF receptor/IRS/PI3K/PKB pathway, and that PI3Kalpha is essential for the potentiatory effect of IGF-1 on platelet responses.},

This is coherent with the emergence of an uninhibited subpopulation of reticulated platelets during treatment with aspirin plus thienopyridine, explained by the short pharmacokinetic half-lives of these drugs. This phenomenon is absent during treatment with ticagrelor, because of its longer half-life and ability to act as a circulating inhibitor.

abstract = {Chronic heart failure (CHF) is a leading cause of mortality in developed countries. Angiotensin II (Ang II) plays an important role in the development and progression of CHF. Many of the important functions of Ang II are mediated by the Ang II type 1 receptor (AT(1)R), including the increase in sympathetic nerve activity in CHF. However, the central regulation of the AT(1)R in the setting of CHF is not well understood. This study investigated the AT(1)R in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) of rabbits with CHF, its downstream pathway, and its gene regulation by the transcription factor activator protein 1 (AP-1). Studies were performed in 5 groups of rabbits: sham (n=5), pacing-induced (3 to 4 weeks) CHF (n=5), CHF with intracerebroventricular (ICV) losartan treatment (n=5), normal with ICV Ang II treatment (n=5), and normal with ICV Ang II plus losartan treatment (n=5). AT(1)R mRNA and protein expressions, plasma Ang II, and AP-1-DNA binding activity were significantly higher in RVLM of CHF compared with Sham rabbits (240.4+/-30.2{\%}, P{\textless}0.01; 206.6+/-25.8{\%}, P{\textless}0.01; 280+/-36.5{\%}, P{\textless}0.05; 207+/-16.4{\%}, P{\textless}0.01, respectively). Analysis of the stress-activated protein kinase/Jun N-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK) pathway showed that phosphorylated c-Jun proteins, phosphorylated JNK proteins, and JNK activity increased significantly in RVLM of CHF compared with sham (262.9+/-48.1{\%}, 213.8+/-27.7{\%}, 148.2+/-10.1{\%} of control, respectively). Importantly, ICV losartan in CHF rabbits attenuated these increases. ICV Ang II in normal rabbits simulated the molecular changes seen in CHF. This effect was blocked by concomitant ICV losartan. In addition, Ang II-induced AT(1)R expression was blocked by losartan and a JNK inhibitor, but not by extracellular signal-regulated kinase or p38 MAP kinase inhibitors in a neuronal cell culture. These data suggest that central Ang II activates the AT(1)R, SAPK/JNK pathway. AP-1 may further regulate gene expression in RVLM in the CHF state.},

abstract = {Since the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) is a pivotal region for regulating the set-point of arterial pressure, we proposed a role for it in the development of neurogenic hypertension. Recent studies have suggested that pro-inflammatory molecules are highly expressed in the NTS of an animal model of human essential hypertension--the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR), compared to normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rat (WKY). Based on this evidence, we hypothesized that inflammatory mediators such as cytokines are up-regulated in the hypertensive NTS. In the present study, we have assessed the level of gene expression of some cytokines in the NTS of SHR compared to WKY. In addition, for further confirmation of abnormal inflammatory condition within the NTS of SHR, we identified gene expression levels of an inflammatory marker, glycoprotein-39 (gp39) precursor, which is homologous to chitinase 3-like protein 1, human cartilage-gp39 or YKL40. The NTS was micro-dissected from 15-week-old male SHR and WKY rats. Total RNA was extracted and quantitative RT-PCR was performed. Gene expression of gp39 precursor and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 were higher in the NTS of SHR while inter-leukin-6 was lower in the NTS of SHR compared to the WKY. In contrast, there were no significant differences in the expression of other cytokines including: inter-leukin-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and transforming growth factor beta 1. These data together with our previous published finding of an over expression of junctional adhesion molecule-1 suggest that the NTS of the SHR exhibits a specific inflammatory state.},

To understand the genetic basis of obesity better, here we conduct a genome-wide association study and Metabochip meta-analysis of body mass index (BMI), a measure commonly used to define obesity and assess adiposity, in up to 339,224 individuals. This analysis identifies 97 BMI-associated loci (P {\textless} 5 × 10(-8)), 56 of which are novel. Five loci demonstrate clear evidence of several independent association signals, and many loci have significant effects on other metabolic phenotypes. The 97 loci account for ∼2.7{\%} of BMI variation, and genome-wide estimates suggest that common variation accounts for {\textgreater}20{\%} of BMI variation. Pathway analyses provide strong support for a role of the central nervous system in obesity susceptibility and implicate new genes and pathways, including those related to synaptic function, glutamate signalling, insulin secretion/action, energy metabolism, lipid biology and adipogenesis.},

abstract = {Sympathoexcitation elicited by central command, a parallel activation of the motor and autonomic neural circuits in the brain, has been shown to become exaggerated in chronic heart failure (CHF). The present study tested the hypotheses that oxidative stress in the medulla in CHF plays a role in exaggerating central command-elicited sympathoexcitation, and that exercise training in CHF suppresses central command-elicited sympathoexcitation through its antioxidant effects in the medulla. In decerebrate rats, central command was activated by electrically stimulating the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR) after neuromuscular blockade. The MLR stimulation at a current intensity greater than locomotion threshold in rats with CHF after myocardial infarction (MI) evoked larger (P {\textless} 0.05) increases in renal sympathetic nerve activity and arterial pressure than in sham-operated healthy rats (Sham) and rats with CHF that had completed longterm (8–12 weeks) exercise training (MI + TR). In the Sham and MI + TR rats, bilateral microinjection of a superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimetic Tempol into the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) had no effects on MLR stimulation-elicited responses. By contrast, in MI rats, Tempol treatment significantly reduced MLR stimulation-elicited responses. In a subset of MI rats, treatment with Tiron, another SOD mimetic, within the RVLM also reduced responses. Superoxide generation in the RVLM, as evaluated by dihydroethidium staining, was enhanced in MI rats compared with that in Sham and MI + TR rats. Collectively, these results support the study hypotheses. We suggest that oxidative stress in the medulla in CHF mediates central command dysfunction, and that exercise training in CHF is capable of normalizing central command dysfunction through its antioxidant effects in the medulla.},

abstract = {Proinflammatory cytokines play an important role in regulating autonomic and cardiovascular function in hypertension and heart failure. Peripherally administered proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$ (TNF-$\alpha$) and interleukin-1$\beta$ (IL-1$\beta$), act on the brain to increase blood pressure, heart rate, and sympathetic nerve activity. These molecules are too large to penetrate the blood-brain barrier, and so the mechanisms by which they elicit these responses remain unknown. We tested the hypothesis that the subfornical organ (SFO), a forebrain circumventricular organ that lacks a blood-brain barrier, plays a major role in mediating the sympathetic and hemodynamic responses to circulating proinflammatory cytokines. Intracarotid artery injection of TNF-$\alpha$ (200 ng) or IL-1$\beta$ (200 ng) dramatically increased mean blood pressure, heart rate, and renal sympathetic nerve activity in rats with sham lesions of the SFO (SFO-s). These excitatory responses to intracarotid artery TNF-$\alpha$ and IL-1$\beta$ were significantly attenuated in SFO-lesioned (SFO-x) rats. Similarly, the increases in mean blood pressure, heart rate, and renal sympathetic nerve activity in response to intravenous injections of TNF-$\alpha$ (500 ng) or IL-1$\beta$ (500 ng) in SFO-s rats were significantly reduced in the SFO-x rats. Immunofluorescent staining revealed a dense distribution of the p55 TNF-$\alpha$ receptor and the IL-1 receptor accessory protein, a subunit of the IL-1 receptor, in the SFO. These data suggest that SFO is a predominant site in the brain at which circulating proinflammatory cytokines act to elicit cardiovascular and sympathetic responses.},

Obesity has emerged as an independent risk factor for complications of atherosclerotic vascular disease. Leptin, a hormone produced by the adipocyte, increases with obesity and appears to modulate energy balance and food intake. In addition, other actions of leptin have been proposed, including an in vitro effect on platelet aggregation. Thus, the elevated plasma leptin levels in obese individuals may promote vascular thrombosis.|To test the hypothesis that leptin contributes to in vivo thrombosis via the leptin receptor.|Between September 2000 and September 2001, a vascular thrombosis model was used to test male 10- to 12-week-old mice completely deficient in leptin or the leptin receptor and mice with platelet leptin-receptor deficiency.|Time to formation of an occlusive thrombus in the common carotid artery following experimentally induced endothelial injury.|Following onset of vascular injury, wild-type mice (n = 8) formed occlusive thrombosis in a mean (SD) of 42.2 (4.6) minutes, whereas leptin-deficient (n = 5) and leptin receptor-deficient mice (n = 7) formed occlusive thrombosis in 75.2 (10.1) and 68.6 (10.3) minutes, respectively (leptin deficient vs wild-type mice, P =.008; leptin-receptor-deficient vs wild-type, P =.03).

abstract = {Baseline platelet production is dependent on thrombopoietin (TPO). TPO is constitutively produced and primarily regulated by receptor-mediated uptake by platelets. Inflammatory thrombocytosis is thought to be related to increased interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels. To address whether IL-6 might act through TPO to increase platelet counts, TPO was neutralized in vivo in C57BL/10 mice treated with IL-6, and hepatic TPO mRNA expression and TPO plasma levels were studied. Transcriptional regulation of TPO mRNA was studied in the hepatoblastoma cell line HepG2. Furthermore, TPO plasma levels were determined in IL-6-treated cancer patients. It is shown that IL-6-induced thrombocytosis in C57BL/10 mice is accompanied by enhanced hepatic TPO mRNA expression and elevated TPO plasma levels. Administration of IL-6 to cancer patients results in a corresponding increase in TPO plasma levels. IL-6 enhances TPO mRNA transcription in HepG2 cells. IL-6-induced thrombocytosis can be abrogated by neutralization of TPO, suggesting that IL-6 induces thrombocytosis through TPO. A novel pathway of TPO regulation by the inflammatory mediator IL-6 is proposed, indicating that the number of platelets by themselves might not be the sole determinant of circulating TPO levels and thus of thrombopoiesis. This regulatory pathway might be of relevance for the understanding of reactive thrombocytosis. {\textcopyright} 2001 by The American Society of Hematology.},

We also found the active form of Src (pTyr418) is up-regulated in platelets from obese individuals, which links proteomics to aggregation data. Moreover, we showed that CRP-activated platelets present higher levels of tyrosine phosphorylated PLC$\gamma$2 in obese patients, confirming alterations in GPVI signalling.

abstract = {Agonist-induced elevation in cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations is essential for platelet activation in hemostasis and thrombosis. It occurs through Ca2+ release from intracellular stores and Ca2+ entry through the plasma membrane (PM). Ca2+ store release is a well-established process involving phospholipase (PL)C-mediated production of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), which in turn releases Ca2+ from the intracellular stores through IP 3 receptor channels. In contrast, the mechanisms controlling Ca2+ entry and the significance of this process for platelet activation have been elucidated only very recently. In platelets, as in other non-excitable cells, the major way of Ca2+ entry involves the agonist-induced release of cytosolic sequestered Ca2+ followed by Ca2+ influx through the PM, a process referred to as store-operated calcium entry (SOCE). It is now clear that stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), a Ca2+ sensor molecule in intracellular stores, and the four transmembrane channel protein Orai1 are the key players in platelet SOCE. The other major Ca2+ entry mechanism is mediated by the direct receptor-operated calcium (ROC) channel, P2X1. Besides these, canonical transient receptor potential channel (TRPC) 6 mediates Ca2+ entry through the PM. This review summarizes the current knowledge of platelet Ca2+ homeostasis with a focus on the newly identified Ca2+ entry mechanisms. {\textcopyright} 2009 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to examine the association between musculoskeletal disorders and the level of obesity (as defined by the body mass index) for a sample of the Australian population aged 20-64. A logistic regression model was used to estimate the association between musculoskeletal disorders and obesity, controlling for a range of socio-demographic characteristics. Individual-level data on obesity, musculoskeletal disorders, and various socio-demographic characteristics were extracted from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) 1995 National Health Survey (NHS). Individuals with musculoskeletal disorders were identified using ICD-9 codes 710-739 from a sample of 28,376 individuals from the non-institutionalised population. Estimates from the logistic regression equation indicate that there is a statistically significant positive relationship between the probability of having a musculoskeletal disorder and the level of obesity. Socio-demographic variables such as age, sex, origin, income level, employment status and geographic location also had a statistically significant relationship. This information can be used by public health practitioners and educators to identify those at risk and to design health strategies that target at-risk patients.},

@article{Yu2010,
abstract = {Inflammation is associated with increased sympathetic drive in cardiovascular diseases. Blood-borne proinflammatory cytokines, markers of inflammation, induce cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) activity in perivascular macrophages of the blood-brain barrier. COX-2 generates prostaglandin E(2), which may enter the brain and increase sympathetic nerve activity. We examined the contribution of this mechanism to augmented sympathetic drive in rats after myocardial infarction (MI). Approximately 24 hours after acute MI, rats received an intracerebroventricular injection (1 microL/min over 40 minutes) of clodronate liposomes (MI+CLOD) to eliminate brain perivascular macrophages, liposomes alone, or artificial cerebrospinal fluid. A week later, COX-2 immunoreactivity in perivascular macrophages and COX-2 mRNA and protein had increased in hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus of MI rats treated with artificial cerebrospinal fluid or liposomes alone compared with sham-operated rats. In MI+CLOD rats, neither perivascular macrophages nor COX-2 immunoreactivity was seen in the paraventricular nucleus, and COX-2 mRNA and protein levels were similar to those in sham-operated rats. Prostaglandin E(2) in cerebrospinal fluid, paraventricular nucleus neuronal excitation, and plasma norepinephrine were less in MI+CLOD rats than in MI rats treated with artificial cerebrospinal fluid or liposomes alone but more than in sham-operated rats. Intracerebroventricular CLOD had no effect on interleukin 1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha mRNA and protein in the paraventricular nucleus or plasma interleukin-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, which were increased in MI compared with sham-operated rats. In normal rats, pretreatment with intracerebroventricular CLOD reduced (P{\textless}0.05) the renal sympathetic, blood pressure, and heart rate responses to intracarotid artery injection of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (0.5 microg/kg); intracerebroventricular liposomes had no effect. The results suggest that proinflammatory cytokines stimulate sympathetic excitation after MI by inducing COX-2 activity and prostaglandin E(2) production in perivascular macrophages of the blood-brain barrier.},

@article{Freedman2010,
abstract = {Background-: Although many genetic epidemiology and biomarker studies have been conducted to examine associations of genetic variants and circulating proteins with cardiovascular disease and risk factors, there has been little study of gene expression or transcriptomics. Quantitative differences in the abundance of transcripts has been demonstrated in malignancies, but gene expression from a large community-based cohort examining risk of cardiovascular disease has never been reported. Methods and results-: On the basis of preliminary microarray data and previously suggested genes from the literature, we measured expression of 48 genes by high-throughput quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in 1846 participants of the Framingham Offspring cohort from RNA derived from isolated platelets and leukocytes. A multivariable stepwise regression model was used to assess clinical correlates of quantitative RNA expression. For specific inflammatory platelet-derived transcripts, including ICAM1, IFNG, IL1R1, IL6, MPO, COX2, TNF, TLR2, and TLR4, there were significant associations with higher body mass index (BMI). Compared with platelets, fewer leukocyte-derived transcripts were associated with BMI or other cardiovascular risk factors. Select transcripts were found to be highly heritable, including GPIBA and COX1. Almost uniformly, heritable transcripts were not those associated with BMI. Conclusions-: Inflammatory transcripts derived from platelets, particularly those part of the nuclear factor $\kappa$ B pathway, are associated with BMI, whereas others are heritable. This is the first study, using a large community-based cohort, to demonstrate clinical correlates of gene expression and is consistent with the hypothesis that specific peripheral-blood transcripts play a role in the pathogenesis of coronary heart disease and its risk factors. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Heart Association, Inc.},

Standardised hazard ratios were extracted and, if there was little risk of confounding, combined using random effects meta-analysis in main analyses. Outcomes included all cause and cardiovascular disease mortality and cardiovascular disease events. Measures of variability included standard deviation, coefficient of variation, variation independent of mean, and average real variability, but not night dipping or day-night variation.|41 papers representing 19 observational cohort studies and 17 clinical trial cohorts, comprising 46 separate analyses were identified. Long term variability in blood pressure was studied in 24 papers, mid-term in four, and short-term in 15 (two studied both long term and short term variability). Results from 23 analyses were excluded from main analyses owing to high risks of confounding. Increased long term variability in systolic blood pressure was associated with risk of all cause mortality (hazard ratio 1.15, 95{\%} confidence interval 1.09 to 1.22), cardiovascular disease mortality (1.18, 1.09 to 1.28), cardiovascular disease events (1.18, 1.07 to 1.30), coronary heart disease (1.10, 1.04 to 1.16), and stroke (1.15, 1.04 to 1.27). Increased mid-term and short term variability in daytime systolic blood pressure were also associated with all cause mortality (1.15, 1.06 to 1.26 and 1.10, 1.04 to 1.16, respectively).|Long term variability in blood pressure is associated with cardiovascular and mortality outcomes, over and above the effect of mean blood pressure. Associations are similar in magnitude to those of cholesterol measures with cardiovascular disease. Limited data for mid-term and short term variability showed similar associations.

In addition, we did a prospective study to follow the STEMI patients over time. Proteins were separated by high-resolution 2D gel electrophoresis, identified by mass spectrometry, and validated by Western blotting. Platelets from STEMI patients on admission displayed 56 protein spot differences (corresponding to 42 unique genes) compared with the control group. The number of differences decreased with time during the patients' follow-up. Interestingly, the adapter protein CrkL and the active form of Src (phosphorylated in Tyr418) were found to be upregulated in platelets from STEMI patients. Major signaling pathways related to the proteins identified include integrin, integrin-linked kinase, and glycoprotein VI (GPVI) signaling. Interestingly, a study on an independent cohort of patients showed a higher degree of activation of GPVI signaling in STEMI patients.|CrkL, the active form of Src, and GPVI signaling are upregulated in platelets from STEMI patients.},

@article{Eknoyan2006,
abstract = {Chronic food shortage and malnutrition have been the scourge of humankind from the dawn of history. The current worldwide epidemic of obesity, now recognized as a public health crisis, is barely a few decades old. Only after the technological advances of the eighteenth century did a gradual increase in food supply became available. The initial effect of these advances in improved public health and amount, quality, and variety of food was increased longevity and body size. These early favorable outcomes of technological advances notwithstanding, their incremental effect since the Second World War has been an overabundance of easily accessible food, coupled with reduced physical activity, that accounts for the recent increased prevalence of obesity. Obesity as a chronic disease with well-defined pathologic consequences is less than a century old. The scarcity of food throughout most of history had led to connotations that being fat was good, and that corpulence and increased "flesh" were desirable as reflected in the arts, literature, and medical opinion of the times. Only in the latter half of the nineteenth century did being fat begin to be stigmatized for aesthetic reasons, and in the twentieth century, its association with increased mortality was recognized. Whereas early reports listed obesity as a risk factor for mortality from "chronic nephritis," the subsequent recognition of the more common association of obesity with diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease altered the listings and questioned its being a risk factor for kidney disease. An enlarging body of evidence, accrued over the past decade, now indicates a direct association of obesity with chronic kidney disease and its outcomes. {\textcopyright} 2006 National Kidney Foundation, Inc.},

Either intravenous or intracerebroventricular administration of IL-1 beta elicited increases in AP, HR, and RSNA accompanied by a rise in body temperature. The maximum changes in AP, HR, and RSNA occurred 10-15 min after intravenous injection of IL-1 beta (100 ng) and 20-25 min after intracerebroventricular injection (5 ng). The responses induced by the intravenous and intracerebroventricular injections lasted for approximately 15-30 min and did not appear when the animals were pretreated with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin (10 mg/kg iv). Moreover, intracerebroventricular injection of prostaglandin E2 (1 microgram) produced responses similar to those induced by IL-1 but with shorter latency. Plasma norepinephrine and adrenocorticotropic hormone concentrations were increased after IL-1 beta injection. The results suggested that IL-1 beta augments cardiovascular and sympathetic outflow through the central action of prostaglandin E2 in conscious rats.},
