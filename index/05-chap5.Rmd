# The effect of obesity on platelet function: a clinical pilot study {#BMI-platelets-clinic}

The following chapter is a specifically designed patient study. Recruitment into this study has been severely affected by COVID-19 as approvals were set in place to start recruitment in March 2020. All data in this chapter was collected by myself, apart from the platelet-neutrophil assay data, which was performed by Dr Chris Williams and the Sysmex haematology analyzer data, which was collected by Dr Kate Burley. Help was required here due to time constraints when receiving patient samples. The proteomic data was analysed by Dr Marieangela Wilson and Dr Kate Heesom at the Proteomics facility at the University of Bristol. Optimised methods have been used within a study to explore the effect of COVID-19 on platelet function given the increased risk of thrombosis. The COVID-19 research has been written up as a manuscript but it has not been included in the thesis due to not aligning with the current aims.

## Background

As detailed in Chapter \@ref(BMI-platelets-INTERVAL), there is evidence that people with a higher BMI have an increased risk of cardiovascular events such as coronary heart disease (CHD) or stroke [@Nordestgaard2012; @Dale2017; @Wolk2003a]. As platelets are one of the key cells involved in haemostasis and thrombosis [@Koupenova2017a], it is likely that a higher BMI has a direct effect on platelet function. The previous chapter provided evidence that higher BMI causes an increase in the production of immature platelets, evidenced by an increase in immature platelet count (IPC). IPC was also positively associated with whole blood platelet aggregation in response to various platelet agonists (adrenaline, protease activating receptor 1 peptide (PAR1-AP/TRAP-6) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP)) in a cardiac surgery cohort. Although these analyses suggest that higher BMI leads to platelet hyperactivity, this association was not directly assessed due to the limited platelet function data available.

Upon activation, platelets adhere to the vessel endothelium, where they undergo shape change, release their granules and aggregate. There are numerous laboratory techniques that can be used to measure platelet function [@Paniccia2015]. Experiments include flow cytometry which use fluorescently tagged antibodies that bind to platelet receptors. Some receptors increasingly expose their ligand binding sites upon stimulation such as the integrin α~IIb~β~3~, which is important for aggregation of platelets (Figure \@ref(fig:platelet-activation-2)). The adhesion receptor P-selectin is expressed on α-granules and is therefore only expressed when platelet secrete their α-granules. Platelet agonists which are able to further expose the integrin α~IIb~β~3~ include PAR1-AP and collagen-related peptide (CRP). Other experiments commonly used to test platelet function include light transmission aggregometry (LTA), which measures the degree of platelet aggregation in response to platelet agonists by how much light passes through the sample. Techniques such as LTA are difficult to implement with patient samples due the requirement of a substantial amount of sample and due to experiments being time consuming. As platelet function declines over a few hours after removal from circulation [@Goss2019], it is preferable to opt for experiments which can be performed quickly. It is also possible to explore the intracellular signalling which occurs within the platelets by using techniques such as Western blotting and tandem mass tag mass spectrometry (TMT-MS), which use targeted and untargeted methods, respectively, to measure protein or phosphoprotein levels.

(ref:caption-platelet-diagram) **Cartoon of integrin α~IIb~β~3~ activation and P-selectin expression on platelets.** Upon platelet activation by a strong agonist such as CRP, the integrin α~IIb~β~3~ exposes its binding site for fibrinogen and cross-links platelets. P-selectin is expressed in the membrane of alpha granules within platelets. Upon platelet activation, platelets secrete these granules and P-selectin is then expressed on the outer membrane. P-selectin on platelets can bind to PSGL-1 leukocytes. Figure made using BioRender.com.

```

Previous studies have attempted to determine the direct effects of BMI on platelet function and signalling, where there is conflicting evidence regarding how BMI affects platelet function [@Barrachina2019; @Nardin2015; @Deharo2014; @Sibbing2007]. Such studies have focused on the relationship between BMI and platelet function in patients receiving dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). In these studies there is evidence that in people with higher BMI, antiplatelet drugs such as prasugrel, which acts at the P2Y~12~ receptor, may not be as effective at suppressing platelet activity [@Deharo2014]. These findings have come from measuring phospho-VASP as an indicator of platelet function at the P2Y~12~ receptor. PGE1 suppresses platelet function by acting at a G~s~ coupled receptor, causing a rise in cAMP and phospho-VASP. Activation of the P2Y~12~ receptor, which is G~i/o~ coupled, by the platelet agonist ADP reduces this VASP phosphorylation. Lower phospho-VASP levels are therefore indicative of less inhibition by the antiplatelet drug and more activation of the platelet by ADP. It is less clear what the relationship is between BMI and platelet function in those who are not on any antiplatelet therapy and across other platelet function assays.

Therefore, the aims of this chapter were to:

1) Optimise laboratory techniques to assess platelet function in a clinical setting.
2) Determine whether high BMI is associated with: an increase in immature platelet count, an increase in platelet function and an alteration in platelet protein expression by comparing platelets from bariatric patients (BMI >40kg/m^2^) to healthy controls (BMI 18-25kg/m^2^) (Figure \@ref(fig:BMI-platelet-overview2)).

## Methods
The platelet function methods and statistical analyses utilised within this study are provided in the Methods chapter (Chapter \@ref(common-methods)).

### Study population
This study was approved by the London Riverside Research Ethics Committee (REC reference 19/LO/1781). All participants provided written informed consent. Patients, who were due to undergo bariatric surgery, with a body mass index of >40kg/m^2^, were recruited from the Department of Bariatric and Metabolic Surgery at Southmead Hospital, Bristol. Participants with a BMI between 18.5 and 25 kg/m^2^ were recruited from the University of Bristol. Inclusion criteria for participants were: aged 18 years and over, able to give written informed consent and sufficient level of English to understand the study and ask any questions. Participants were excluded if they were pregnant or lactating, had any known clotting or bleeding disorders (e.g. von Willebrand disease or drug-induced thrombocytopenia), or if they had taken any antiplatelet medication within the previous 14 days such as clopidogrel, ticagrelor or aspirin or any other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Recruitment occurred between May 2021 and June 2021. As a pilot study, a total of four bariatric patients with obesity and four age and sex-matched control participants were recruited. Bariatric patients donated blood before bariatric surgery.

## Results

### Participant characteristics
The characteristics of participants included in the study are shown in Table  \@ref(tab:obesity-platelets-participants). The mean BMI in the control group was 21.8 kg/m^2^ (SD 2.1 kg/m^2^) and 49.3 kg/m^2^ (SD 8.8 kg/m^2^). Participants in the control group and bariatric patient group were age and sex matched. All bariatric patients and control participants were non-smokers. Half of the bariatric patients presented with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and were receiving T2D medication, whereas none of the control participants had T2D. Similarly, 75% of the bariatric patients had previously had a positive test for COVID-19 but none of the control participants had ever tested positive for COVID-19.

### Platelet parameters

Platelet traits measured by Sysmex were compared across bariatric and control groups (Table \@ref(tab:obesity-platelets-parameters)). There was no statistical evidence for an effect of obesity on platelet parameters. However, IPC and IPF did display larger mean values compared to controls, but they also had relatively large SDs in the bariatric patient group (IPC 9.3 (SD 4.9) x 10^9^/L in control vs 16.3 (SD 16.3) x10^9^/L in bariatric group, p=0.45).

### Basal receptors
Activation of the integrin α~IIb~β~3~ and expression of P-selectin were compared across bariatric and control groups to see whether there was a difference in basal platelet activation. Basal integrin α~IIb~β~3~ activation and P-selectin expression were similar across groups (Figures \@ref(fig:basal-integrin-pselectin-receptor-bariatric)A and B). Expression of other platelet surface receptors in unstimulated platelets were also compared using specific antibodies. Levels of GPVI, CD42b (GP1bα), CD41 (integrin α~IIb~), CD61 (Integrin β~3~) and CD110 (thrombopoietin/TPO receptor) were not different across groups (Figure \@ref(fig:basal-integrin-pselectin-receptor-bariatric)C).

### Agonist-induced integrin α~IIb~β~3~ activation and P-selectin expression

Markers of platelet activation were compared in response to different platelet agonists. There was weak evidence that the integrin α~IIb~β~3~ maximum response was reduced in the bariatric patient group in response to PAR1-AP (2479 AU (SEM 126) in control vs 2105 AU (SEM 101) in bariatric group, p=0.06) and ADP (2526 AU (SEM 121) in control group vs 2274 AU (SEM 478), p=0.05), but there was no change in the pEC50s across groups. There was insufficient data to compare the pEC50s and max of the curves for CRP, however comparing the highest concentration of CRP, there was no difference in response across the bariatric and control group for activation of the integrin α~IIb~β~3~ (Figures \@ref(fig:agonist-integrin-pselectin)A-C). There was no difference in the levels of P-selectin across bariatric patients and control groups in response to PAR1-AP or ADP (Figures \@ref(fig:agonist-integrin-pselectin)D and E) as determined by the pEC50 or the curve maximum values. There was no evidence for a difference in expression of P-selectin across bariatric and control groups in response to the highest concentration of CRP ((Figure \@ref(fig:agonist-integrin-pselectin)F).

### Platelet-neutrophil aggregates

Next, platelet-neutrophil interactions were explored to determine whether there was a difference in the proportion of neutrophils that are bound to platelets, therefore demonstrative of a difference in inflammation and hyperactive platelets. This was explored by gating neutrophils using an antibody for the specific neutrophil marker, CD45, and their side scatter (granularity). Within this gate, the percentage of neutrophils interacting with platelets was determined by using an antibody for the platelet specific marker CD41 (integrin α~IIb~ subunit) and determining the percentage of events that were both CD45+ and CD41+. There was no difference in the percentage of neutrophils bound to platelets under basal conditions (7.0 % (SEM 1.5 %) in control v 11.2 % (SEM 3.2%) in bariatric patient group, p=0.30). Similarly, after stimulation with CRP, there was no difference in the percentage of neutrophil-platelet aggregates (38.6 % (SEM 2.6 %) in control group v 35.5 % (SEM 2.7 %), p=0.48).

### Platelet proteomics

A total of 5318 proteins were detected from platelets of both groups of participants by tandem mass tag mass spectrometry (TMT-MS). A principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on the protein data. PC1 and PC2 explained 27.1 % and 14.4 % of the variance in the data, respectively. A PC plot of PC1 against PC2 is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:pca). PC1 plotted against PC2 did not separate the bariatric patient samples from the control participant samples, despite grouping of three patients (Figure \@ref(fig:pca)). PC3 and PC4 explained 13.1% and 12.6% of the data respectively. When plotting PC3 against PC4, there is separation among the groups (Figure \@ref(fig:pca2)). This suggests that the group was not the main source of variation between the data.

```

There was evidence (p<0.05) that 188 out of a total of 5318 detected platelet proteins (3.5%) were altered in bariatric patients with obesity compared to controls (Figure \@ref(fig:volcano)). Positive logFC values indicate the protein having higher levels in the bariatric group. The protein which had the strongest evidence for a BMI effect was phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase beta (PI4K-beta) (logFC 0.45, p=6.3x10^-5^). The signalling protein G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK6) was lower in bariatric patients (logFC -0.15, p=0.002), whereas the adipocyte plasma membrane-associated protein (APMAP) was increased in bariatric patients (logFC 0.23, p=0.006). Platelet proteins previously reported [@Barrachina2019] to be associated with BMI replicated here, including gelsolin (logFC -0.14, p=0.018), actin (cytoplasmic 1, logFC 0.51, p=0.03) and septin-2 (logFC 0.14, p=0.03). Platelet transcripts have been reported to be associated with BMI, including transcripts for myeloperoxidase and protein S100-A9 [@Freedman2010]. The current study provides evidence that these alterations in transcripts directly relate to protein levels measured in the proteomics analysis as BMI group was associated with both myeloperoxidase (LogFC 1.15, p=0.04) and protein S100-A9 (logFC 1.48, p=0.049). Similar to the flow cytometry results, no alteration in protein receptors such as the α~IIb~ integrin and GPVI receptor was detected.

## Discussion

This chapter explored the effect of obesity on platelet parameters and platelet function by collecting pre-surgery samples from bariatric patients and age and sex-matched controls. Here, I have optimised common experimental laboratory techniques for use within a patient study. In addition, these techniques have also been used to study platelet function within another patient group (COVID-19) and can be implemented in future patient studies. The present study did not detect functional differences in platelet parameters and between bariatric patients compared to healthy controls, but proteomics analysis by TMT-MS detected differences in platelet protein abundance, which may have implications for platelet signalling. 

This study did not detect differences in platelet characteristics such as IPC when comparing the high BMI bariatric surgery group with the control group. The small sample size and large standard deviation in the high BMI group would explain why the BMI and IPC association detected in Chapter \@ref(BMI-platelets-INTERVAL) was not detected in the current study. There was also no evidence for a difference in levels of platelet receptors under basal conditions. A difference in P-selectin expression in response to agonists across the bariatric patient and control group was not detected, however, there was weak evidence that activation of the integrin α~IIb~β~3~ was impaired in the bariatric patient group. This reduction is modest so it is unclear whether this would impact the ability of platelets to aggregate. A previous study (unpublished) from the Hers group and published data from other groups [@Taus2020] indicated that in severe COVID-19 there is a large reduction (~60% reduction) in platelet integrin α~IIb~β~3~ activation, but an increase in the percentage of platelets bound to neutrophils therefore suggesting there is hyperactivity. It is therefore possible that impaired integrin activation may be a marker of platelet hyperactivity. A similar reduction in integrin α~IIb~β~3~ activation was reported in platelets from patients with myeloproliferative disorders who also have a prothrombotic phenotype [@Moore2013]. Despite this, in the current study there was no difference in the percentage of neutrophils bound to platelets in the bariatric surgery group. This may be because the reduction in integrin α~IIb~β~3~ activation was not large enough (it was only ~10% reduction in the bariatric surgery group in response to ADP).

One previous study detected an increase in GPVI receptor levels and GPVI mediated platelet aggregation [@Barrachina2019]. Despite this previous finding, Barrachina et al. did not directly measure activation of the integrin α~IIb~β~3~, so it is unclear how this increase in expression would translate to the activation of this integrin. A larger sample size would be required to be able to draw conclusions here. As well as this, aggregation experiments would have also been useful to compare platelet function across groups, however this technique was not chosen due to time restraints and large amount of sample required.

The principal component analysis of the proteomic data suggested that PC4 was able to separate the bariatric and control groups. Although PC4 was not the main source of variance, even with a small N number, this provided evidence that the group (bariatric/control) could explain variation in proteins. Therefore, some protein signatures may be due to the difference in BMI. However, it could also be due to other factors which differed across groups such as previous COVID-19 infection or T2D diagnosis. Concordance with previous studies in terms of proteins reportedly altered with BMI also suggests that the current study is likely capturing platelet protein signatures of obesity. Table \@ref(tab:proteome-lit) shows the results that have replicated in the current study when comparing to three previous studies that have studied the platelet proteome [@Barrachina2019], platelet microvesicle proteome [@Grande2019] and platelet transcriptome in relation to obesity [@Freedman2010].

Evidence from the current study and results from Barrachina et al [@Barrachina2019]. point towards platelet proteins which may be altered with obesity such as actin, gelsolin and septin-2. Actin is important in platelet shape change and activation [@Bearer2002; @Barrachina2019]. Higher actin levels in platelets from patients with obesity could contribute to platelet hyperactivity. Mutations in the gene which encodes actin (ACTB) can cause Baraitser-Winter cerebrofrontofacial syndrome (BWCFF). Patients with this syndrome have been reported to have a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) with enlarged platelets and a higher immature platelet fraction [@Latham2018]. This actinopathy is known as ACTB-associated syndromic thrombocytopenia. It is therefore possible that increased levels of actin may be indicative of more newly produced platelets. Gelsolin is another platelet cytoskeletal protein, which was lower in the bariatric patient group. Gelsolin levels were shown to be lower in PRP from patients with stable angina pectoralis compared with controls, however they were higher in patients with unstable angina pectoralis and acute myocardial infarction patients [@Yue2011]. Recombinant human gelsolin has been shown to be protective against thromboembolism in mice, thereby suggesting that reduced levels seen in the current study could increase thrombosis risk [@Gupta2019]. Septins are cytosolic proteins which are also reported to be important in integrin α~IIb~β~3~ activation, platelet spreading and clot contraction [@Kim2020]. Septin-2 levels were higher in platelets from bariatric patients, suggesting this may lead to increased platelet activation. Although no difference was found in α~IIb~β~3~ activation, it would be useful to explore whether there are differences in platelet aggregation and platelet spreading.

There is also overlap between platelet proteins altered with BMI in the current study and platelet transcripts that are reported to be altered with higher BMI [@Freedman2010]. For example, S100A9 (Myeloid-related protein-14 or MRP-14) transcripts were altered with BMI and the levels of the protein were increased in the bariatric group in the current study. Studies in mice have found evidence that S100A9 is involved in thrombus formation [@Wang2014a], and there is evidence for its involvement in myocardial infarction [@Cai2020]. Likewise, myeloperoxidase (MPO) transcripts were associated with BMI and there were higher protein levels in bariatric patients with obesity. A previous study has shown evidence that MPO can potentiate ADP-induced platelet aggregation in PRP [@Gorudko2013].

These platelet proteins have previously been reported to be associated with BMI and are therefore more likely to be robust associations. This study has also provided some novel platelet proteins which have different levels in bariatric patients with obesity compared with healthy weight controls. For example, there was an increase in levels of APMAP in platelets from the high BMI group. A SNP which is associated with higher plasma levels of APMAP (rs8125909) is associated with higher BMI and greater weight [@Liu2021], therefore it is possible that the protein is involved in weight regulation, rather than higher BMI altering levels of the protein. Following up this protein after bariatric surgery could help determine the directionality of the effect. There was also a decrease in levels of G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK6) in the high BMI group. GRKs phosphorylate G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that have been activated by agonists, thereby leading to receptor desensitisation [@Chaudhary2020]. GRK6 knockout mice have been shown to have larger aggregatory responses to agonists and more dense and α-granule secretion, along with increased thrombus formation [@Chaudhary2020] as a result of less receptor desensitisation occurring. Together, these results therefore reflect a platelet proteomic footprint of higher BMI that implicates a hyperactive platelet environment. Investigating the role of these proteins would be informative. It would also be important to explore additional measures of platelet activation such as platelet aggregation, calcium mobilisation and in vitro thrombus formation, as well as replicating experiments in a larger cohort.

In the proteomics analysis, a post hoc power calculation was performed to determine the range of power for the effect sizes where p<0.05. This study had at least 67% power to detect effect sizes, but for some proteins which had smaller p values, there was 100% power. A larger sample size would be required to be able to detect smaller effect sizes.

Overall, this study optimised experimental techniques to test platelet function from patients. Sample sizes were limited and only small differences were detected in platelet function experiments and Sysmex platelet parameters. Platelet proteomic analysis replicated previous findings in relation to proteins which may be altered by BMI and implicated some novel proteins which are altered by BMI and may lead to changes in platelet function. Larger sample sizes of participants which display more similar characteristics would be required to confirm findings.
