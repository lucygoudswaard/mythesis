# Pathways linking plasma proteins and platelet function: do the chemokines MDC and TARC play a role? {#chemokine-platelets}

## Background

Platelets likely contribute to the increased CVD risk related to obesity. The previous chapters have indicated that higher BMI may contribute to raising IPC and may affect the platelet proteome. This may have implications for platelet function. Other published work has demonstrated that platelets from patients with obesity are hyperactive and have a lower sensitivity to antiplatelet therapies such as clopidogrel[@Nardin2015]. These therapies are critical in the prevention of ischaemic events in certain circumstances. The underlying mechanisms that cause general platelet hyperactivity in obesity is not completely understood. It is likely to involve a combination of factors. One such factor could be a decrease in the production of endothelial PGI2 and nitrous oxide[@BelindeChantemele2012a]. Another contributing factor could be an alteration in the circulating levels of soluble ligands, growth factors and cytokines as a result of low grade chronic inflammation[@Esser2014]. These proteins may subsequently enhance platelet function (known as platelet priming). Platelet primers are signaling molecules which enhance agonist-induced platelet function but in isolation are unable to activate platelets. Molecules that have been reported to be able to prime platelets include insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)[@Nardin2015; @Blair2015] and thrombopoietin (TPO)[@Maury2010a].

There are other biomarkers which are also suggested to be raised with obesity as a result of low-grade chronic inflammation[@Esser2014], including the chemokines macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC/CCL22) and thymus and activation regulated chemokine (TARC/CCL17)[@Safa2016]. These inflammatory chemokines act at the receptor CCR4, which is expressed on platelets[@Clemetson2000]. MDC and TARC have been shown to potentiate platelet aggregation[@Gear2001]. For example, the presence of TARC and MDC have been demonstrated to greatly enhance platelet aggregation in the presence of low levels of the platelet agonist ADP[@Gear2001]. Furthermore, gene polymorphisms of MDC and CCR4 are associated with myocardial infarction (MI), therefore implicating MDC in thrombosis pathophysiology[@Noori2018]. Previous studies have shown that multiple platelet primers increase platelet function through activation of the lipid kinase phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)[@Blair2015; @Pasquet2000; @Falcinelli2005]. Another pathway that has been implicated in platelet priming effects is the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. TPO can enhance thromboxane A~2~ (TxA~2~) synthesis through increasing the activation of extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK2)[@Ezumi1998; @VanWilligen2000]. The common involvement of both PI3K and MAPK pathways in platelet priming mediated by IGF-1, TPO and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) suggests that MDC and TARC could also exert priming effects through these common pathways. 

As blood/plasma levels of MDC have been reported to be elevated in people with obesity[@Safa2016] and polymorphisms of its receptor are associated with MI, understanding the mechanisms by which MDC can enhance platelet function may provide important insight in to how platelets are hyperactive in obesity and potentially provide a novel target for new antiplatelet/thrombotic or preventative therapies for those with an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Furthermore, If MDC and TARC are able to mediate the effect of obesity on platelet function, this may suggest that exploring the effect BMI on the general plasma proteome is required in order to identify other potential protein mediators. The aims of this chapter were therefore to determine the effects and mechanisms of MDC and TARC on platelet function and signalling and explore the effect of increasing levels of MDC and TARC on disease using two sample Mendelian randomisation. Investigation of the effect of BMI on levels of MDC and TARC will be explored in Chapters \@ref(BMI-protein-MR) and \@ref(BMI-protein-RCT). Figure \@ref(fig:chemokine-platelet-graphic) indicates the parts of the overall thesis hypotheses which are addressed in the current chapter.

## Methods

### Materials
Materials used for the current chapter are listed in section \@ref(materials).

### Isolation of human platelets
This study was approved by the local ethics committee. Fresh human venous blood was obtained from healthy volunteers by venipuncture in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants provided written informed consent. Participants confirmed they had not taken any antiplatelet medications such as NSAIDs in the 14 days prior to donation. Blood was taken into the syringe with a 1 in 10 volume of 4 % trisodium citrate, then mixed with a 1 in 7 volume of acid citrate dextrose (ACD). Blood was placed into 5 mL LP4 tubes then centrifuged at 1000 revolutions per minute (RPM) for 17 minutes. Platelet rich plasma (PRP) was removed. PRP was supplemented with inhibitors such as 0.02 U/mL apyrase, 140 nM PGE1 or 10 µM indomethacin. Supplemented PRP was either used for the experiment or centrifuged for a further 10 minutes at 1700 RPM. Platelet poor plasma (PPP) was removed leaving a platelet pellet. This pellet was resuspended in HEPES Tyrode’s (supplemented with 0.1 % glucose and 0.02 U/mL apyrase, and 10 µM indomethacin if already applied to PRP). Platelets were counted using a Z1 coulter particle counter by diluting 1 in 2000 in 10 mL MQ water. Platelets were diluted further using the supplemented HEPES Tyrode’s to a platelet concentration of 4 x 10^8^/mL and left to rest for 30 mins in a 30°C water bath.

### Integrin α~IIb~β~3~ activation and P-selectin expression measured by flow cytometry
Washed platelets were diluted to a concentration of 2 x 10^7^/mL using supplemented HEPES Tyrode’s buffer with FITC-conjugated PAC1 and PE-conjugated CD62P antibodies in a 2:1 ratio, where PAC1 was present at a 1:10 volume and CD62P at 1:20. Platelets were incubated with 200 ng/ml MDC, TARC or vehicle for 5 mins followed by stimulation with increasing concentrations of PAR1-AP for 10 minutes. Platelets were fixed with a final concentration of 1 % paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 10 minutes. Plates were analysed using the BD Accuri C6 Plus flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, Wokingham, UK), where the median fluorescence intensity was derived from 10,000 gated platelets. 

### Platelet aggregation
Platelets were diluted to a concentration of 2 x 10^8^/mL using supplemented HEPES Tyrode’s buffer. A volume of 250 µL platelets was added to aggregometer cuvettes containing a Teflon stir bar. HEPES Tyrode’s (500 µL) was added to the reference PPP (blank) channel. Platelets were left to rest in the cuvettes for 2 mins. For priming experiments, platelets were either preincubated with vehicle (MQ) or 1 µg/ml MDC or TARC for 5 mins. A Chrono-log model 490 aggregometer was used. For experiments which were not exploring platelet priming, platelets were added to the cuvettes for 2 minutes and agonist was added for 5 minutes.  Aggregation traces were derived from the amount of light transmitted through the sample. Recordings were taken for 5 minutes with a stirring speed of 1200 RPM and at 37 °C. Platelets were used within 3 hours from resting.

### Plate platelet aggregation
PRP supplemented with apyrase was used. For each donor, the platelet count was recorded. PPP was used as a reference. PRP was added to the wells of a 96 well plate and left to rest for 2 minutes. 200 ng/ml MDC, 200 ng/mL TARC or vehicle were preincubated with platelets for 5 minutes. After 5 minutes, PAR1-AP was added to the wells and the plate was shaken with an Eppendorf ThermoMixer® for 5 minutes at 1200 RPM and at 37 °C. The plate was immediately read using a Labtech LT-4500 automatic microplate absorbance reader. Responses were normalized so that basal PRP = 0 % aggregation and PPP = 100 % aggregation.

### Phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure
Washed platelets were used at a concentration of 2 x 10^7^/mL. Platelets were preincubated with vehicle, 200 ng/mL MDC or 200 ng/mL TARC for 5 mins. Platelets were then stimulated 5 ug/mL CRP as well as increasing concentrations of thrombin for 10 mins. PE-conjugated annexin V (1:10 v/v) was used to bind to PS. Plates were read using the BD Accuri flow cytometer, where the % positive (annexin V) were recorded.

### Flow cytometry: phospho-VASP
Washed platelets were diluted to a concentration of 1 x 10^8^/mL. Platelets were left to rest in a 96 well plate for 2 minutes to warm to 37 °C. 200 ng/ml MDC, 200 ng/mL TARC, 10 µM ADP or vehicle were preincubated with platelets for 5 mins at 37 °C. PGE1 (concentration-response curve) was added for a further 5 minutes. Platelets were fixed with 1 % PFA for 10 minutes. Platelets were centrifuged in a 96 well plate at 2651 RPM for 10 minutes (Heraeus Megafuge with M-20 Microplate Swinging Bucket Rotor, ThermoFisher Scientific). Supernatant was then discarded, and platelets were permeabilized with 0.1% TritonTM X-100 for 10 minutes. The plate was centrifuged again at 2651 RPM for 10 minutes. Supernatant was discarded and platelets were washed and resuspended in 1 x PBS. Platelets were centrifuged at 2651 RPM for 10 minutes. Supernatant was discarded and platelets were resuspended with rabbit pSer157 VASP primary antibody (1 in 1000) for 30 minutes on ice. Platelets were centrifuged at 2651 RPM for 10 minutes. Supernatant was discarded and platelets were washed and resuspended with 1 x PBS. Platelets were centrifuged at 2651 RPM for 10 minutes. Supernatant was discarded and platelets were resuspended with secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor™ 647 anti-rabbit IgG, 1 in 1000) for 45 minutes on ice. Platelets were centrifuged at 2651 RPM for 10 minutes. Supernatant was discarded and platelets were washed with 1 x PBS. Platelets were centrifuged once more at 2651 RPM for 10 minutes, resuspended once more in 1 x PBS and the plate was read using a BD Accuri C6 Plus flow cytometer and using the APC-A channel.

### Western blotting
Platelets were used at a concentration of 4 x 10^8^/mL. Platelets were preincubated with 200ng/mL MDC, 200ng/mL TARC or vehicle for 5 minutes followed by 5 minutes application of PAR1-AP (all at 30 °C). For phospho-VASP assay, MDC, TARC or ADP were preincubated with platelets for 5 minutes, with PGE1 added for a further 5 minutes. Platelets were lysed with 4 X LDS NuPAGE sample buffer supplemented with 50 mM dithiothreitol (DTT). Samples were stored at -20 °C. Samples were heated to 70 °C for 10 minutes prior to SDS-PAGE. A 10 % Resolving gel was cast for Tris-glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and a 5 % Stacking gel was cast for loading. As a standard, 4 µl Precision Plus protein pre-stained standard was loaded, along with 20 µl of the lysate sample. The samples were placed in a tank containing 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid (MOPS) running buffer (50 mm MOPS, 50 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 5 mm sodium bisulfite) and protein electrophoresis was carried out for 90 minutes at 100 V. Following this, proteins were transferred to a poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PDVF) membrane in the presence of transfer buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 192 mM glycine, 20% methanol) for 60 minutes and at 100 V. The membrane was then incubated in LI-COR blocking buffer with 0.1 % TBS-Tween in a 1:1 ratio for 1 hour. Membranes were incubated with the primary antibody (1 in 1000 dilution) at room temperature overnight. Talin was used as a loading control. The membrane was washed 3 times with 0.1 % TBS-Tween for 5 minutes. The membrane was incubated with Fluor680 labelled secondary antibody (1 in 5000 dilution) for 1 hour. The membrane was washed 6 times for 5 minutes, then membranes were scanned using the LI-COR Odyssey® CLx Imaging System. Bands were quantified using Image Studio Lite. 

### Calcium mobilisation
Fura-2 (4 µM) was added to PRP after the addition of indomethacin and apyrase and incubated for 1 hour wrapped in foil at 37 °C. PRP was centrifuged and platelets were resuspended in supplemented HEPES Tyrode’s as described above, with washed platelets (at 4 x 10^8^/mL) protected from the light with foil. Platelets were recalcified with 1 mM calcium chloride using the Tecan Infinite M200 multimode plate reader (Mannedorf, Switzerland). Fluorescence of fura-2 was measured as the ratio at wavelengths 340:380 nm and provided a measurement of free calcium. 10 basal recordings were taken over 1 minute before addition of MDC, TARC or ADP. Upon agonist stimulation, 20 readings were taken over 2 minutes. A final concentration of 1 % Triton X-100 was added to permeabilise platelets and further readings were raken as a reference for maximum calcium mobilisation.

### Statistical analysis for platelet function assays
Data was analysed using GraphPad Prism 8. If data displayed a normal distribution (based on Shapiro-Wilk p-value and W statistic), a parametric test was used (e.g. unpaired t-test or one way ANOVA), otherwise a nonparametric test was used. Concentration-response curves were plotted using a four parameter variable slope. To compare concentration-response curve parameters, pEC50s or curve maxes were compared. A Fisher's exact test was used to compare proportions of categorical variables. Statistical tests used for each experiment are in figure legends. Strength of evidence is determined by p-values, however results will not be dichotomised as either 'significant' or 'not significant'[@Sterne2001]. 

### Two sample MR look-up using EpigrahDB
Mendelian randomisation is a method which uses genetic variants as instrumental variables to provide a causal estimate of the relationship between a modifiable exposure and health outcome[@Davies2018]. Two sample MR uses summary statistics and allows for causal effects to be estimated where the exposure and outcome are measured in different populations[@Davies2018]. EpigraphDB is a tool which performs two sample MR to determine how the human proteome contributes to complex diseases[@Zheng2020]. Protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) were available for MDC and TARC from the INTERVAL study (N=3301), which were rank normal transformed[@Sun2018]. Therefore a systematic exploration of the possible roles of MDC and TARC in disease was performed. These SNPs were associated with these proteins at p<5x10^-8^. GWAS summary statistics that were publically available for disease outcomes were included. A list of the available outcomes are presented on EpigraphDB https://www.epigraphdb.org/pqtl/list/outcomes. As an example, the venous thromboembolism variables were from Neale lab: https://github.com/Nealelab/UK_Biobank_GWAS). The venous thromboembolism (VTE) units are derived from a case/control linear mixed model. For MDC, there was one instrument available, therefore a Wald ratio was used to estimate the causal effect[@Lawlor2008]. There were two instruments available for TARC, therefore the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method was used, which assumes all genetic variants are valid instrumental variables[@Burgess2013]. The pQTLs used were trans pQTLs (located >500 kb from the leading pQTL). The instruments used were categorised as Tier 1 instruments, which passed both pleiotropy and consistency tests[@Zheng2020]. As a total of 225 outcomes were searched, a Bonferroni-adjusted p-value of 0.05/225 = 2.2x10^-4^ was utilised to account for multiple testing.

## Results

### Priming effects of MDC and TARC on platelet aggregation in washed platelets using light transmission aggregometry

To investigate the effect of MDC and TARC on agonist-induced platelet aggregation, MDC and TARC were preincubated before addition of PAR1-AP. Figure \@ref(fig:MDC-TARC-agg)A shows an example aggregation trace from one donor where PAR1-AP and vehicle induced only shape change, but the presence of MDC and TARC induced a maximal aggregation response. A submaximal concentration of PAR1-AP (ranging from 0.7 to 1 µM) and vehicle induced a mean aggregation of 7.0 % (SEM 2.9 %) aggregation (Figure \@ref(fig:MDC-TARC-agg)B). In the presence of 1 µg/ml MDC, this aggregation increased to 33 % (SEM 13 %) (MDC v vehicle, p = 0.15). In the presence of 1 µg/ml TARC, there was 46 % (SEM 11 %) aggregation (TARC v vehicle, p < 0.05). Similar effects were observed with MDC and TARC on the area under the aggregation curve (Figure \@ref(fig:MDC-TARC-agg)C).

### Priming effects of MDC and TARC on platelet aggregation in PRP

Next, the priming effect of MDC and TARC was explored on platelet aggregation in PRP using plate aggregation, to see whether priming also occurs in the presence of plasma. Plate aggregation allows exploration of more conditions than LTA, therefore full concentration-response curves can be constructed. MDC and TARC were not able to potentiate the aggregation induced by increasing concentrations of PAR1-AP (Figure \@ref(fig:MDC-TARC-agg-PRP)A). There was no difference in the pEC50 for comparing vehicle with MDC and TARC (Figure \@ref(fig:MDC-TARC-agg-PRP)B).

### Priming effects of MDC and TARC on PAR1-AP induced integrin α~IIb~β~3~ activation and P-selectin expression

When a platelet becomes activated by an agonist, the integrin α~IIb~β~3~ changes conformation and is activated on the membrane of the platelet. This allows fibrinogen to bind and for platelet aggregation to occur. Following platelet activation, alpha granules fuse with the platelet plasma membrane and P-selectin becomes expressed on the plasma membrane. To assess whether MDC and TARC affect integrin α~IIb~β~3~ activation and P-selectin expression, washed platelets were incubated with vehicle, 200 ng/ml MDC or TARC prior to PAR-AP stimulation. MDC enhanced integrin α~IIb~β~3~ activation, with a leftward shift in the PAR1-AP concentration response curve (pEC50= -5.54 M (SEM 0.10 M) to -5.66 M (SEM 0.08 M), p=0.02). Preincubation with TARC had the same effect as MDC, left shifting the concentration-response curve (pEC50 = -5.54 M (SEM 0.11 M) to -5.64 M (SEM 0.11 M), p=0.01, Figure \@ref(fig:MDC-TARC-integrin-pselectin)A). MDC and TARC did not affect maximal integrin activation. As the concentration of PAR1-AP applied to the platelets gets higher, more P-selectin was exposed and therefore there was an increase in the MFI. The pEC50 for the PAR1-AP effect on P-selectin expression was -5.36 (SEM 0.07) (Figure \@ref(fig:MDC-TARC-integrin-pselectin)B). Preincubation with 200 ng/ml MDC caused a small leftward shift in pEC50 to -5.44 (SEM 0.07) (MDC v vehicle, p=0.006), but preincubation with 200 ng/ml TARC did not alter the sensitivity to PAR1-AP. Together these results show that MDC and TARC are able to potentiate platelet activation mainly through integrin α~IIb~β~3~. In the absence of PAR1-AP, both MDC and TARC potentiated integrin α~IIb~β~3~ activation: increasing basal levels from a median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of 161 (SEM 20) to 222 (SEM 27) (vehicle v MDC, p=0.006) and to 285 ± 36 (vehicle v TARC, p=0.007) respectively (Figure \@ref(fig:MDC-TARC-integrin-pselectin)C). This effect was specific to integrin α~IIb~β~3~ as it was not seen with P-selectin.

### Effects of MDC and TARC on PS exposure

When a platelet is activated by strong agonists, such as dual stimulation by collagen-related peptide (CRP) and thrombin, PS is translocated from the inner platelet membrane to the outer, thereby facilitating coagulation by providing binding sites for prothrombinase complex and supporting thrombin generation[@Reddy2020]. Annexin V is a protein which binds with high affinity to PS and can be used to measure the proportion of platelets which are PS positive. MDC and TARC did not affect the overall percentage of annexin V positive platelets induced by CRP and thrombin (Figure \@ref(fig:MDC-TARC-PS-exposure)).

### Effects of MDC and TARC alone on aggregation in washed platelets 

MDC and TARC were applied to washed platelets to determine whether they exert effects on platelet aggregation in the absence of an agonist. MDC and TARC did not cause platelet aggregation, however they did cause an upward deflection on the aggregation trace (Figure \@ref(fig:MDC-TARC-wp-alone-aggregation)). This upward deflection is a reduction in light passing through the sample, indicating that the platelets may be undergoing shape change.

### Effects of MDC and TARC alone on calcium mobilisation

Calcium mobilisation was measured by using a fluorescent dye, Fura-2, which binds to intracellular calcium. Increasing concentrations of ADP were added to washed platelets as a positive control, where increasing calcium mobilisation was observed (\@ref(fig:MDC-TARC-wp-calcium)A). MDC and TARC alone were also able to increase calcium mobilisation in a concentration-dependent manner (\@ref(fig:MDC-TARC-wp-calcium)B), however caused a much smaller calcium response than ADP.

### Mechanism of MDC and TARC priming in washed platelets
MDC and TARC activate the platelet receptor CCR4, which can reportedly couple to G~i/o~. PGE~1~ inhibits platelets by acting at a G~s~ coupled receptor, thereby increasing levels of cAMP and activating protein kinase A (PKA). PKA subsequently phosphorylates VASP. One mechanism by which MDC and TARC may therefore increase platelet function is by activating the G~i~ pathway, which would oppose cAMP inhibition of platelet function. ADP acts at the P2Y~12~ receptor which is G~i/o~ coupled, therefore it reduces PGE~1~ induced VASP phosphorylation. To explore whether MDC and TARC activate G~i~ signaling, the effect of MDC and TARC on VASP phosphorylation in the presence and absence of PGE~1~ was explored. PGE~1~ increased the phosphorylation of VASP at both Ser^157^ and Ser^239^. Figure \@ref(fig:MDC-TARC-wp-WB-VASP) shows a representative blot from one donor. There was little evidence for an effect of MDC, TARC and ADP reducing basal VASP levels (Figure \@ref(fig:MDC-TARC-wp-VASP-bar)A, C). As a positive control, ADP (10 µM) reduced the phosphorylation of VASP induced by 100 nM PGE~1~ at both Ser^239^ by 62 % SEM (18 %) (ADP v vehicle, p=0.048, Figure \@ref(fig:MDC-TARC-wp-VASP-bar)B) and at Ser^157^ by 44 % (SEM 21 %) (ADP v vehicle, p=0.048, Figure \@ref(fig:MDC-TARC-wp-VASP-bar)D). In contrast, there was not strong evidence that MDC and TARC reduced the phosphorylation of VASP induced by 100 nM PGE1 at Ser^239^ or at Ser^157^ (Figures \@ref(fig:MDC-TARC-wp-VASP-bar)B, D). This was also true for 10 nM and 30 nM PGE1 (data not shown). Phospho-VASP at Ser^157^ was also measured using flow cytometry (Figure \@ref(fig:MDC-TARC-VASP-FACS)). PGE~1~ increased phosphorylation of VASP in a concentration-dependent manner, with a pEC50 of -8.36 M (SEM 0.16 M). Pre-incubation with ADP shifted this response to the right to give a pEC50 of -6.95 M (SEM 0.17 M) (ADP v vehicle, p=0.002). MDC and TARC did not alter the PGE1 phosphorylation of VASP. Together, these results indicate that MDC and TARC do not signal through G~i~-coupled receptors in human platelets, or too weakly to detect using Western blotting or flow cytometry.

### Mechanisms of the effect of MDC on platelet aggregation in PRP

The mechanism by which these chemokines cause platelet aggregation in PRP was further characterised just using MDC. MDC-induced platelet aggregation was explored using various inhibitors. To test that the antagonists used were specific, they were first applied to PAR1-AP. As expected, the CCR4 antagonist AZD-2098 did not affect PAR1-AP platelet aggregation. The G~q~ inhibitor YM-254890 inhibited PAR1-AP induced platelet aggregation (Figures \@ref(fig:MDC-PRP-agg-bar)A, B). Y27632 inhibited the G~12/13~ mediated shape change induced by low concentrations of PAR1-AP (0.75 uM) due to inhibiting rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) (data not shown). 

The effects of these inhibitors on MDC-induced aggregation were then explored. MDC by itself was able to consistently cause over 60% aggregation in PRP. The CCR4 inhibitor AZD-2098 was able to reduce this aggregation, but only at 50 uM (Figures \@ref(fig:MDC-PRP-agg-bar)C, \@ref(fig:MDC-PRP-agg-trace)A, B). The G~q~ inhibitor YM-254890 was able to reduce the maximum aggregation induced by MDC (Figure \@ref(fig:MDC-PRP-agg-bar)C, Figure \@ref(fig:MDC-PRP-agg-trace)C), suggesting CCR4 couples to G~q~. Y27632 did not affect aggregation induced by MDC, suggesting that this aggregation is not dependent on G~12/13~ and ROCK (Figure \@ref(fig:MDC-PRP-agg-bar)D, \@ref(fig:MDC-PRP-agg-trace)D). Application of MDC to PRP did not cause shape change.

### Two sample Mendelian randomisation to assess the role of MDC (CCL22) and TARC (CCL17) in disease

To estimate potential causal relationships bewteen circulating levels of MDC and TARC and disease, a two sample MR was performed using pQTL data for these chemokines and available disease outcome data. Results are displayed for estimates where p<0.05, however due to multiple testing, the p-value threshold was adjusted to 2.2x10^-4^. Results are presented as the change in outcome per SD higher protein. There was evidence from the Wald ratio MR that higher MDC had a causal effect on three outcomes: high cholesterol (Effect size = 0.22 SD, SE = 0.02, p=2.2x10^-26^), DVT (Effect size = 0.22, SE 0.021, p=2.2x10^-26^) and pulmonary embolism (Effect size = 0.33, SE 0.08, p=2.0x10^-5^). There was not strong evidence for an effect of higher levels of TARC on any of the included outcomes. Results of the two sample MR are shown for MDC and TARC in tables \@ref(tab:MDC-disease-MR) and \@ref(tab:TARC-disease-MR).

## Discussion

This study explored the effects of the chemokines MDC and TARC on platelet function and signalling. Evidence suggested that MDC and TARC were able to potentiate platelet function induced by the agonist PAR1-AP in washed platelets. There was not strong evidence that this potentiation was mediated by a G~i/o~-coupled receptor. Functional experiments indicated that MDC and TARC are not only able to prime platelets, but that they are also able to cause a small calcium response and platelet shape change when applied alone in washed platelets. Experiments in PRP indicated that MDC is able to cause full aggregation and that this is due to the CCR4 receptor, and that this is G~q~ coupled. Two sample MR was performed to estimate the causal effect of higher levels of MDC and TARC on disease. These results suggested that higher levels of MDC increased the risk of DVT and PE. These effects could be due to activation of platelets. 

Previous studies have attempted to explore the effects of MDC and TARC on platelet function. There is evidence that MDC and TARC potentiate ADP-induced aggregation[@Gear2001]. The current study provides evidence that this is also the case with PAR1-AP, therefore this effect is not agonist specific. MDC and TARC alone have been shown to elicit a calcium response, but only in PRP can aggregation occur[@Abi-Younes2001, @Petito2018, @Kowalska2000]. This is likely due to components in PRP such as arachidonic acid or the presence of other platelet primers such as IGF-1. The current chapter confirmed these findings, where only shape change was achieved in washed platelets, but in PRP MDC could induce aggregation. As well as confirming previous findings, this chapter provided some novel observations. For example, this chapter explored whether MDC and TARC can potentiate PS exposure. There was no evidence that MDC and TARC could potentiate the procoagulant effects induced by CRP and thrombin. This may be because the signalling elicited by MDC and TARC may not be strong enough to affect PS exposure.

Platelets express chemokine receptors as they are also key cells in inflammation and host defense[@Clemetson2000]. MDC and TARC can also cause activation of platelets, thereby demonstrating the close link between inflammation and haemostasis[@Gear2003].

As well as functional effects, this chapter aimed to assess whether effects are due to the CCR4 receptor and the downstream signalling involved. It has been reported that MDC inhibits calcium currents in HEK293 cells and barium currents dorsal root ganglia neurones and is therefore G~i/o~ coupled[@Oh2002]. MDC and TARC were not able to reduce VASP phosphorylation induced by PGE1, suggesting that the effects are not via G~i/o~ in platelets. It is possible that this experiment was not sensitive enough to detect the reduction in VASP phosphorylation, as ADP did not reduce VASP levels as much as previous reports[@Hezard2005]. Another study suggested that CCR4 is coupled to G~q~ due to the calcium response observed by MDC[@Kowalska2000]. Inhibiting G~q~ coupling in the current study inhibited the aggregation induced by MDC. It is therefore likely that CCR4 couples to G~q~.

MDC and TARC have been implicated in CVD such as atherosclerosis[@Weber2004], but experiments focusing on the effect of MDC and TARC on platelet function have not used genetic epidemiology to explore whether genetic variants which lead to alterations in the levels of circulating MDC and TARC in the plasma are associated with an increased risk of disease. As MDC and TARC can activate platelets, the effect of MDC and TARC on disease was explored using two sample MR. The SNP that was associated with levels of MDC, rs77542162, was also associated with increased risk of DVT and pulmonary embolism. This effect may occur due to increased platelet priming by higher levels of MDC. Patients at risk of developing VTE have a hypercoagulant state and are prescribed anticoagulants to reduce the risk. Experiments indicated that MDC could not potentiate PS exposure, a marker of coagulation, therefore suggesting that MDC does not increaes the risk through an increase in coagulation. Further experiments are required to determine how MDC could mediate the risk of VTE. Despite the evidence for a causal effect, it is possible that this SNP could affect the outcome through routes other than through the exposure (horizontal pleiotropy). For example, the SNP could also be associated with increased in number of red blood cells, thereby increased risk of VTE. This is also reflected by other outcomes being related to increased levels of MDC such as forced vital capacity (FVC). As there is only one SNP, sensitivity analyses cannot be performed to test this. Further analyses such as a colocalisation analysis could help determine whether the relationship between MDC and DVT/PE is causal as this method estimates whether an exposure and an outcome share a causal top signal in a particular genomic region[@Giambartolomei2014].

This chapter has provided evidence for a an effect of MDC and TARC on platelet function and indicated possible mechanisms of effect. As mentioned in the introduction of the current chapter, there is evidence that patients with obesity have higher circulating levels of MDC[@Safa2016], however the effect of BMI and levels of these chemokines needs to assessed in a larger cohort and using a causal framework. The SOMAScan proteomics panel detects these circulating chemokines, therefore further exploration of the effect of BMI on these chemokines will be presented in Chapter \@ref(BMI-protein-MR) by using one sample MR and Chapter \@ref(BMI-protein-RCT) which utilises a weight loss RCT.

### Conclusions

Overall, this chapter provided evidence that the chemokines MDC and TARC potentiate platelet aggregation induced by PAR1-AP. On their own in washed platelets, a small calcium response can be observed as well as shape change, but PRP is required to observe full aggregation. Signalling experiments suggest MDC and TARC act at the CCR4 receptor on platelets, and that G~q~ coupling is responsible for the functional effects observed. There was evidence that higher MDC may have a causal effect on DVT and PE. MDC may therefore be a biomarker for venous thromboembolism. Further work is required to determine signalling, and further cohort studies would be useful to confirm effects of MDC on DVT and PE.
